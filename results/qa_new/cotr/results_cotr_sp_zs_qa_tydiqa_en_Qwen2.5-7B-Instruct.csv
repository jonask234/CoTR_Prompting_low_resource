Before the Meiji Restoration, Japan's feudal fiefs all issued their own money, hansatsu, in an array of incompatible denominations. The New Currency Act of 1871 did away with these and established the yen, which was defined as 1.5g (0.048 troy ounces) of gold, or 24.26g (0.780 troy ounces) of silver, as the new decimal currency. The former han (fiefs) became prefectures and their mints private chartered banks, which initially retained the right to print money. To bring an end to this situation the Bank of Japan was founded in 1882 and given a monopoly on controlling the money supply.[3]",['1871'],...,...,"...

The neck was proportionally long in relation to the trunk. The hands were proportionally the shortest of any ornithomimosaur and each had three digits with curved claws. The forelimbs were weak while the hindlimbs were proportionally long. ",['70 million years ago'],...,...,"...

en-validation-433,Why is he called Mega man?,"Although originally the names ""Mighty Kid"", ""Knuckle Kid"", and ""Rainbow Battle Kid"" were proposed, Capcom eventually settled on ""Rockman"" as Mega Man's Japanese moniker. The word ""Rock"" in Rockman is a reference to the music genre rock and roll, and is meant to work in tandem with his sister robot, Roll. However, Capcom Consumer Products Division president Joe Morici changed the name from Rockman to Mega Man because he felt ""The title was horrible.""[6] In addition, the original Mega Man titles intentionally incorporated a ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" gameplay mechanic into defeating certain enemies.[3][7] The pixel art for the character was created by the designer of the original game in the series, Akira Kitamura (credited under the pseudonym ""A.K""),[8] and later turned into a refined illustration by Keiji Inafune.[2][9][10] Kitamura originally intended Mega Man to be colored white, but instead settled on blue to make his animations more clear. Mega Man's design had a lot of little influences from various manga, anime, and tokusatsu shows, specifically Ninja Captor.[11]","['president Joe Morici changed the name from Rockman to Mega Man because he felt ""The title was horrible']",...,...,"...

en-validation-113,What is the first step in making cheese?,"To make cheese, the cheesemaker brings milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required.  For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').",['the cheesemaker brings milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid'],[Your English Translation of the Question],[Your English Translation of the Context],"[Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question]
