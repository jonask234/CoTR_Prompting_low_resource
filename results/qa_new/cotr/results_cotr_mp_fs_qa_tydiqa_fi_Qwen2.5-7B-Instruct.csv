Maan johtaja Erich Honecker erosi 18. lokakuuta. Uusi hallitus päätti marraskuussa lievittää hiukan ankaria matkustusrajoituksia ihmisten lepyttämiseksi. Tiedotteen lukija Günter Schabowski ei ollut mukana päätöksenteossa eikä tiennyt yksityiskohtia, ei myöskään sitä, että päätöksen piti astua voimaan vasta seuraavana päivänä. Schabowski sekosi papereissaan suorassa lähetyksessä ja ilmoitti, että matkoja muurin toiselle puolelle tehtäisiin vastedes ilman ennakkoehtoja. Hän vastasi italialaistoimittajan kysymykseen: ”Minun tietääkseni voimassa heti, ilman viivettä.” Tämä ilmoitettiin myös länsisaksalaisilla televisiokanavilla ja pian kymmenet tuhannet uteliaat ihmiset ryntäsivät muurille. Hämmästyneet rajavartijat eivät tienneet, mitä tehdä pääsyä muurin toiselle puolelle vaatineille ihmismassoille. Koska vaihtoehtona olisi ollut omien kansalaisten ampuminen, rajavartijat antoivat periksi ja päästivät kansanjoukot läpi. Muurin toisella puolella heitä tervehtivät riemuitsevat länsiberliiniläiset.

It is a biennial international song competition for musicians from Europe and Israel, featuring original songs performed in the performers' native languages. The contest began as a way for European broadcasters to collaborate and share content, and it has since become one of the longest-running annual events in the world. The first contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland, with seven countries participating. Since then, it has grown significantly, with over 40 countries now taking part each year. The contest is broadcast to an average of 150 countries and has a global audience of hundreds of millions of viewers. The show is typically held in May, with the winner being determined by public votes from the participating countries. The contest has evolved over the years, with changes in format, scoring systems, and presentation styles, but its core concept of bringing together European and Israeli artists to compete through song remains unchanged.

Ruotsalaisia on asunut Viron alueella ainakin 1200-luvulta lähtien. 1210- ja 1220-luvulla saksalaiset ja tanskalaiset valloittivat virolaisten alueet. Virolaisia ei ollut perinteisesti asunut paljon rannikoilla. Tästä syystä paikalliset kartanonherrat alkoivat houkutella ruotsalaisia siirtolaisia mailleen. Ruotsalaisia pidettiin myös ehkä luotettavampina kuin hiljattain käännytettyjä virolaisia.[1] Siitä, mistä Viroon muuttaneet ruotsalaiset tulivat, ei ole tarkkaa tietoa, eikä muuttoliikettä mainita ruotsalaisissa aikalaislähteissä. Siirtolaisia tuli ilmeisesti Gotlannista, Ruotsin itärannikolta ja Suomen ruotsalaisyhteisöistä. Varhaisin kirjallinen lähde ruotsalaisista Virossa on vuodelta 1294 Haapsalusta. Lähteessä mainittiin ruotsalaisia elävän paitsi Haapsalussa myös Saarenmaan alueella. 1200-luvun siirtolaisten määrä lienee ollut pieni. Siirtolaisia tuli enemmän 1340-luvulla, kun virolaisten epäonnistunut yrjönyön kapina tyhjensi kyliä ja maatiloja.[1] Ruotsalaisten muuttoaalto Viroon oli huipussaan 1400- ja 1500-luvulla. Siirtolaiset saivat niin sanotun ruotsalaisoikeuden, joka takasi heille paremman oikeudellisen aseman ja lievemmän verotuksen kuin virolaisille.[2] Samaan aikaan virolaisista tuli käytännössä maaorjia.[1] 1560-luvulla ruotsalaisia oli Virossa noin 1000.[3] Ruotsalaisten maahanmuutto loppui 1500-luvun aikana, ja heidän määräänsä vähensivät sodat, joita käytiin alueella 1560-luvulta 1640-luvulle saakka. Sodat ja taudit tappoivat luultavasti yli puolet ruotsalaisväestöstä, ja heidän määränsä palautui 1560-luvun lukemiin vasta 1600-luvun puolivälissä.[1]",['1210- ja 1220-luvulla saksalaiset ja tanskalaiset valloittivat virolaisten alueet.

Charles Sanders Peirce (September 10, 1839, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States – April 19, 1914, Milford, Pennsylvania, United States) was an American philosopher, logician, scientist, and polymath.[1] He is especially known as the founder of philosophical pragmatism, his work in mathematical logic, his semiotic research (including the development of the concept of the triadic sign), his fallibilist and realist philosophy of science, and his interpretation of German idealism and Darwin's theory of evolution as leading to an objective idealism expressed in a metaphysical system. At the center of Peirce's philosophy is his doctrine of three categories, which he justified by developing a form of phenomenology similar to Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, later called ""phenenology"" or ""faneroscopy"" (phaneroscopy).[2][3] However, Peirce's scientific work encompassed more than just philosophy and logic, extending into many other fields such as natural sciences, mathematics"," Cambridge, Massachusetts I don't know Yes No Cambridge, Massachusetts", Minä tiedän ei.,,11.740038394927979
