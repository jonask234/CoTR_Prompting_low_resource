Sille ilmestyi kaksi yhtä lailla menestynyttä jatko-osaa Imperiumin vastaisku (1980) ja Jedin paluu (1983); näistä kolmesta elokuvasta koostuu alkuperäinen Tähtien sota -trilogia. Esiosatrilogia ilmestyi myöhemmin vuosina 1999–2005, joka sai faneilta ja kriitikoilta kriittisemmän vastaanoton kuin alkuperäinen trilogia. Kaikki kuusi ovat joko voittaneet tai olleet ehdolla Oscar-palkintojen saajiksi, ja ne ovat tuottaneet yhteensä 4,38 miljardia dollaria.[1] Se on tällä hetkellä maailman toiseksi eniten tuottanut elokuvasarja.[2] Sarjaa laajennettiin suuremmaksi mediajatkumoksi Expanded Universen kautta, johon kuuluu kirjoja, televisiosarjoja, videopelejä, ja sarjakuvia.",['25. toukokuuta 1977'],"""When was the first Tähtien sota movie released?""

Maan johtaja Erich Honecker erosi 18. lokakuuta. Uusi hallitus päätti marraskuussa lievittää hiukan ankaria matkustusrajoituksia ihmisten lepyttämiseksi. Tiedotteen lukija Günter Schabowski ei ollut mukana päätöksenteossa eikä tiennyt yksityiskohtia, ei myöskään sitä, että päätöksen piti astua voimaan vasta seuraavana päivänä. Schabowski sekosi papereissaan suorassa lähetyksessä ja ilmoitti, että matkoja muurin toiselle puolelle tehtäisiin vastedes ilman ennakkoehtoja. Hän vastasi italialaistoimittajan kysymykseen: ”Minun tietääkseni voimassa heti, ilman viivettä.” Tämä ilmoitettiin myös länsisaksalaisilla televisiokanavilla ja pian kymmenet tuhannet uteliaat ihmiset ryntäsivät muurille. Hämmästyneet rajavartijat eivät tienneet, mitä tehdä pääsyä muurin toiselle puolelle vaatineille ihmismassoille. Koska vaihtoehtona olisi ollut omien kansalaisten ampuminen, rajavartijat antoivat periksi ja päästivät kansanjoukot läpi. Muurin toisella puolella heitä tervehtivät riemuitsevat länsiberliiniläiset.

Ruotsalaisia on asunut Viron alueella ainakin 1200-luvulta lähtien. 1210- ja 1220-luvulla saksalaiset ja tanskalaiset valloittivat virolaisten alueet. Virolaisia ei ollut perinteisesti asunut paljon rannikoilla. Tästä syystä paikalliset kartanonherrat alkoivat houkutella ruotsalaisia siirtolaisia mailleen. Ruotsalaisia pidettiin myös ehkä luotettavampina kuin hiljattain käännytettyjä virolaisia.[1] Siitä, mistä Viroon muuttaneet ruotsalaiset tulivat, ei ole tarkkaa tietoa, eikä muuttoliikettä mainita ruotsalaisissa aikalaislähteissä. Siirtolaisia tuli ilmeisesti Gotlannista, Ruotsin itärannikolta ja Suomen ruotsalaisyhteisöistä. Varhaisin kirjallinen lähde ruotsalaisista Virossa on vuodelta 1294 Haapsalusta. Lähteessä mainittiin ruotsalaisia elävän paitsi Haapsalussa myös Saarenmaan alueella. 1200-luvun siirtolaisten määrä lienee ollut pieni. Siirtolaisia tuli enemmän 1340-luvulla, kun virolaisten epäonnistunut yrjönyön kapina tyhjensi kyliä ja maatiloja.[1] Ruotsalaisten muuttoaalto Viroon oli huipussaan 1400- ja 1500-luvulla. Siirtolaiset saivat niin sanotun ruotsalaisoikeuden, joka takasi heille paremman oikeudellisen aseman ja lievemmän verotuksen kuin virolaisille.[2] Samaan aikaan virolaisista tuli käytännössä maaorjia.[1] 1560-luvulla ruotsalaisia oli Virossa noin 1000.[3] Ruotsalaisten maahanmuutto loppui 1500-luvun aikana, ja heidän määräänsä vähensivät sodat, joita käytiin alueella 1560-luvulta 1640-luvulle saakka. Sodat ja taudit tappoivat luultavasti yli puolet ruotsalaisväestöstä, ja heidän määränsä palautui 1560-luvun lukemiin vasta 1600-luvun puolivälissä.[1]",['1210- ja 1220-luvulla saksalaiset ja tanskalaiset valloittivat virolaisten alueet.

Peircen filosofian keskiössä on hänen kolmen kategorian oppinsa, jonka oikeuttamiseksi Peirce kehitti Edmund Husserlin fenomenologiaa muistuttavan niin ikään ""fenomenologiaksi"" ja myöhemmin ""faneroskopiaksi"" (phaneroscopy) kutsumansa opin.[2][3] Peircen tieteellinen työ kattoi kuitenkin filosofian ja logiikan lisäksi myös monia muita aloja, esimerkiksi luonnontieteitä, matematiikkaa ja psykologiaa, ja vaikka Peirce tunnetaan nykyään lähinnä filosofina ja loogikkona, hän ei koskaan toiminut palkkatyössä tai tutkijanvirassa näillä aloilla. Hänet tunnettiin omana aikanaan lähinnä luonnontieteilijänä.
