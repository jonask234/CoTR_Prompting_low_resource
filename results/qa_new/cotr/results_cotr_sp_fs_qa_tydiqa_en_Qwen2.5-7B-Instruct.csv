Richard and Mary had two children, both of whom had died by 1819.[lower-alpha 4] Early in 1820 he went bankrupt; later that year on the death of his father, he was invited to succeed him as steward of the Fixby estate, looking after a rent roll of £18,000 per year, on an annual salary of £300. He accepted, moving to Fixby Hall in 1821.[2] When in 1827 the vicar of Halifax (in which parish Fixby lay) attempted to increase his income by 'resuming' collection of various tithes which he claimed to be 'customary', Oastler was prominent in opposition.[12] He later claimed that it was this struggle that had broken his health, leaving him liable to periodic breakdowns in health.[13]",['two'],[Your English Translation of the Question] English Context: [Your English Translation of the Context] English Answer: [Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question] English Answer: [English translation of your answer] English Question:,[Your English Translation of the Context] English Answer: [Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question] English Answer: [English translation of your answer] English Question:,[Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question] English Answer: [English translation of your answer] English Question:,[Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question] English Answer: [English translation of your answer] English Question:,,,,English Question: [Your English Translation of the Question] English Context: [Your English Translation of the Context] English Answer: [Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question] English Answer: [English translation of your answer] English Question:,,1.3964533805847168

en-validation-104,When did the yen become the official currency of Japan?,"The concept of the yen was a component of the Meiji government's modernization program of Japan's economy; which postulated the pursuit of a uniform currency throughout the country modeled after the European decimal currency system.
Before the Meiji Restoration, Japan's feudal fiefs all issued their own money, hansatsu, in an array of incompatible denominations. The New Currency Act of 1871 did away with these and established the yen, which was defined as 1.5g (0.048 troy ounces) of gold, or 24.26g (0.780 troy ounces) of silver, as the new decimal currency. The former han (fiefs) became prefectures and their mints private chartered banks, which initially retained the right to print money. To bring an end to this situation the Bank of Japan was founded in 1882 and given a monopoly on controlling the money supply.[3]",['1871'],[Your English Translation of the Question],[Your English Translation of the Context],"[Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question]

en-validation-79,How do you put out a grease fire?,"Fires are classified by the proper extinguishing agent.  While water is used on Class A fires, using water on a Class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous.[3][5] This is because burning grease is hotter than the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius); when water is placed on grease, it creates steam which expands rapidly and splatters, causing burns and spreading the fire).[3] Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use dry chemicals (foam or powder),[5] such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211).[6]  or highly pressurized carbon dioxide.[5] Some fire extinguishers contain chemicals designed to fight both Class A and Class B fires.[6]","['use dry chemicals (foam or powder),[5] such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211).[6]  or highly pressurized carbon dioxide']",[Your English Translation of the Question],[Your English Translation of the Context],"[Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question]

Gallimimus was toothless with a keratinous (horny) beak, and had a delicate lower jaw. Many of the vertebrae had openings that indicate they were pneumatic (air-filled). The neck was proportionally long in relation to the trunk. The hands were proportionally the shortest of any ornithomimosaur and each had three digits with curved claws.

The word ""Rock"" in Rockman is a reference to the music genre rock and roll, and is meant to work in tandem with his sister robot, Roll. However, Capcom Consumer Products Division president Joe Morici changed the name from Rockman to Mega Man because he felt ""The title was horrible.""[6] In addition, the original Mega Man titles intentionally incorporated a ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" gameplay mechanic into defeating certain enemies.[3][7] The pixel art for the character was created by the designer of the original game in the series, Akira Kitamura (credited under the pseudonym ""A.K""),[8] and later turned into a refined illustration by Keiji Inafune.[2][9][10] Kitamura originally intended Mega Man to be colored white, but instead settled on blue to make his animations more clear.

en-validation-113,What is the first step in making cheese?,"To make cheese, the cheesemaker brings milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, as is the case with unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required.  For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').",['the cheesemaker brings milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a temperature required to promote the growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid'],[Your English Translation of the Question],[Your English Translation of the Context],"[Your English Answer based on the English Context and Question]
