2. **Translate English Hypothesis:** The sentence 'Rubani huwa kamili kwa mawasiliano.' translates to:

Based on the provided Swahili premise and hypothesis, let's follow the steps:

1. **Translate English Premise:** 
   The translated English premise is: ""It is known that not all languages require a phonetic transcription, but when the Japanese use every word of English in their business, their trade suffers.""

2. **Translate English Hypothesis:**
   The translated English hypothesis is: ""Names are widely used to refer to multiple languages.""

3. **Perform English NLI:**
   After analyzing the translated premise and hypothesis, we can determine that there is no direct logical connection between them. The premise discusses the usage of phonetic transcriptions in business contexts involving Japanese and English, while the hypothesis talks about the use of names referring to multiple languages. These two statements do not necessarily imply each other nor contradict each other; they are independent claims.

**English NLI Label:** neutral

This conclusion is reached because the premise does not provide any information that would support or refute the claim made in the hypothesis, and vice versa. They discuss different aspects without any clear logical relationship. Therefore, the correct NLI label is ""neutral."" --- Based on the provided Swahili premise and hypothesis, here are the translations and the final NLI label:
