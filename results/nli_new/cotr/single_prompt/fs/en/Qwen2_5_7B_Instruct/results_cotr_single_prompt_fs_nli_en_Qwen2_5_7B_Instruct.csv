Translated English Premise: You should have seen the danger.
Translated English Hypothesis: You must not look at the crisis happening at this very moment.
English NLI Label: contradiction
--- Explanation ---
The premise suggests that there was a situation where seeing the danger would be beneficial or important. However, the hypothesis advises against looking at the current crisis, which directly contradicts the idea presented in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the two statements is contradictory. --- Original English Premise: 'You should have seen the danger.'
Original English Hypothesis: 'You must not look at the crisis happening at this very moment.'

Translated English Premise: You should have seen the danger.
Translated English Hypothesis: You must not look at the crisis happening at this very moment.
English NLI Label: contradiction
--- Explanation ---
The premise implies that observing the danger could have been advantageous or necessary. On the other hand, the hypothesis strongly advises against looking at the current crisis. These two statements are in direct opposition to each other, hence they are contradictory. ---
