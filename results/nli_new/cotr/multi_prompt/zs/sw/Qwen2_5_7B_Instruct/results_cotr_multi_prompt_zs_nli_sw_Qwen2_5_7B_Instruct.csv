Your translation is close but not entirely accurate. Here's a more precise version:

The provided translation is mostly accurate, but it can be refined for clarity and precision. Here's an improved version:

""Yousef could not travel to Pakistan, but his friend Murad, whom KSM had previously identified as someone who could assist Yousef with the operation, agreed to do so for $3,000. He also cooperated with the investigation regarding the fatal injury.""

This version maintains the original meaning while improving readability and flow. The term ""gharabia"" (which means ""to carry out"" or ""to perform"") has been replaced with ""assist,"" which better conveys the context of helping with the operation. Additionally, the phrase ""kuhohoajiwa"" (which literally means ""resulted from"") has been changed to ""fatal,"" making the sentence more concise and clear. Finally, ""kufufunika"" (which means ""to agree"") is used instead of ""agreed to do so""","Murad did not like the pelelezi at the location of Yousef's cricket, from Pakistan.
It seems there might be a few errors or unclear terms in your original Swahili sentence. ""Pelelezi"" is not a commonly used word in Swahili and could potentially refer to something specific within the context you're discussing. 

Assuming that ""pelelezi"" refers to some kind of cricket equipment or setup (since it's mentioned in relation to Yousef's cricket), here’s a more refined version of the sentence with an educated guess about what “pelelezi” might mean:

Swahili text: Murad aliwajulisha wateja ya cricket yake mahali pa kumpata Yousef kule Pakistani.

English translation: Murad did not like the cricket gear at Yousef's playing field, which was in Pakistan.

Also, it's worth noting that there isn't actually a city named ""Florida"" in the United States. It sounds like this might refer to the state of Florida. So if you meant to specify the state, the sentence would read:

""Dr. Field worked as a dentist in the city of [specific city name], Florida.""

The English translation of the given Swahili text is:

""And I was impressed, U2's second album.""

Here, ""nilikuwa"" translates to ""I was,"" ""nikuweka"" means ""impressed,"" and ""milango mitano nje ya U2's"" refers to ""U2's second album."" The word order in the English translation has been adjusted for natural flow. 

Note that ""mitano"" can mean both ""second"" (ordinal) or ""middle"" (cardinal), but in this context, it is used as an ordinal number to indicate the second album. Therefore, ""second"" is the correct interpretation here. If there were any ambiguity, additional context would be needed to clarify whether ""mitano"" should be translated as ""middle"" or ""second.""

The correct and more natural English translation of ""Mimi daima nitashukuru"" is:

""I always thank.""

To break it down:

- ""daima"" means ""always""
- ""ni"" is a form of ""to be"" (in this case, present tense)
- ""tashukuru"" is the first-person singular form of the verb ""to thank""
