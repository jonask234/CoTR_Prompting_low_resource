""The remaining dimensions are imagined as curved on the scale of the Planck length in what is called Calabi-Yau spaces, or more generally, compactified moduli.""

This sentence discusses a concept from theoretical physics, particularly string theory and related areas.

These compactified dimensions can take various geometric forms, with Calabi-Yau manifolds being one type of space that has been extensively studied due to their rich mathematical structure and potential relevance for describing the geometry of our universe within string theory frameworks. Compactified moduli refers to the parameters that describe how these extra dimensions are compactified; these parameters themselves can vary, leading to different possible configurations of the extra dimensions.","The Calabi-Yau spaces extend over a large area.
