This translation conveys the idea that certain geometric structures (Calabi-Yau spaces) exist with specific properties related to their curvature and size, which can be understood in terms of both microscopic (Planck length scale) and macroscopic (larger scales) perspectives. The term ""compactified"" refers to how extra spatial dimensions are thought to be curled up or hidden from our everyday experience at large scales.

The provided translation has some inaccuracies. Here is a corrected version:

""New Brunswick separated from Nova Scotia in 1784 when it became an independent province due to the requests of approximately 14,000 loyal refugees from the narrow strip known as Chignecto.""

Key corrections:
- ""Chignecto Consec"" was likely a mistranslation; ""Consec"" should be ""Cticks,"" which refers to the region.
- ""Narrow strip connecting Nova Scotia and New Brunswick"" more accurately describes what Chignecto was at that time. 

So, the final accurate translation would read:

""New Brunswick separated from Nova Scotia in 1784 when it became an independent province due to the requests of approximately 14,000 loyal refugees from the narrow strip known as Chignecto.""
