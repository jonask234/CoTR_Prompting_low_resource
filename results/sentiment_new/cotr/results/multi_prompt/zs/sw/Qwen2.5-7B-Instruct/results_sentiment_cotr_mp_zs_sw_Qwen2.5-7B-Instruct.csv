The phrase ""unaweza kujihudumia binafsi kupitia maelekezo ya IVRJM"" was translated as ""you can access the service yourself through the IVRJM menu"". The word ""radhi"" was removed as it was not part of the original Swahili text provided. The number ""100"" was kept as is since it likely refers to a specific service number. The acronym ""IVRJM"" was left unchanged as it appears to be a system or service name. The final period was added to complete the sentence.
