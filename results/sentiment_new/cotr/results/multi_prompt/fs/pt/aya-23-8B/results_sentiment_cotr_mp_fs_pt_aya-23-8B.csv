Alguém tem sonífero? Dormi o dia todo agora não tenho sono💔😪,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Somebody has a sleeping pill? I slept all day now I don't have sleep 💔😪'

This is an example of a common mistake that people make when translating from Portuguese to English.

'I am going to the store.'

'I'm going to the store.'

In this example, the difference in the two sentences is subtle but important. In the first sentence, the verb is in the present tense ('am'), indicating that the action will happen in the near future. In the second sentence, the verb is in the present progressive tense ('am going'), indicating that the action is happening right now.

Here's another example:

'She is my friend.'

'She's my friend.'

In this case, the contraction 'she's' is used instead of the full form 'is'. This is a common occurrence in spoken English, but it's not correct in written English. To use the contraction correctly, you would need to say 'she is my friend'.

So, always be careful when using contractions in your writing. Remember to use the full form of the verb if you're not sure whether to use a contraction or not.

'I am going to the store.'

'I'm going to the store.'

'She is my friend.'

'She's my friend.'
