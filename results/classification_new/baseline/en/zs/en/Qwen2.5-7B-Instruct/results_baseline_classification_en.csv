After the Bank of England raised interest rates from 2.25% to 3%, Jeremy Hunt said the ""best single thing we can do"" is to help the Bank bring down inflation.
He added: “We are doing the same things that we are asking families to do, up and down the country.""

"/news/uk-england-london-63034300","Instagram posts about suicide and depression viewed by a 14-year-old girl before she took her own life ""were safe"", an inquest has heard.
Molly Russell, from Harrow, engaged with thousands of such posts in the months before her death in 2017.
Her family claim the content encouraged suicide and self-harm.
Elizabeth Lagone, an executive at Meta which owns Instagram, said she believed it was ""safe for people to be able to express themselves"" online.
She added the posts were ""complex"" and often a ""cry for help"".
quest at North London Coroner's Court was told out of the 16,300 posts Molly saved, shared or liked on Instagram in the six-months before her death, 2,100 were depression, self-harm or suicide-related.
Ms Lagone, the social media giant's head of health and wellbeing, was shown a number of them.
Russell family's lawyer, Oliver Sanders KC, asked of each post shown to her whether she believed they promoted or encouraged suicide or self-harm.
She said she thought it ""safe for people to be able to express themselves"", but conceded two posts would have violated Instagram's policies.
Instagram's guidelines at the time said users were allowed to post content about suicide and self-harm to ""facilitate the coming together to support"" other users but not if it ""encouraged or promoted"" this.
Ms Lagone told the court she thought the content Molly saw was ""nuanced and complicated"", adding it was important to give people a voice if they were experiencing suicidal thoughts.
In a heated exchange which saw Mr Sanders shout, he asked why Instagram allowed children on the platform when it was ""allowing people to put potentially harmful content on it"" and suggested Meta ""could just restrict it to adults"".
Ms Lagone replied the topic of harm was an ""evolving field"" and that Instagram policies were designed with consideration to users aged 13 and over. 
When pressed by coroner Andrew Walker to clarify whether she thought the posts were safe, she replied ""Yes, it is safe"".
She said Meta's understanding was there was no clear research into the effect posts have on children but their research reported a ""mixed experience"".
Questioning why Instagram felt it could choose which material was safe for children to view, the coroner then asked: ""So why are you given the entitlement to assist children in this way?
""Who has given you the permission to do this? You run a business.
""There are a great many people who are ... trained medical professionals. What gives you the right to make the decisions about the material to put before children?""
Ms Lagone responded: ""That's why we work closely with experts.""
She added decisions were not ""made in a vacuum"".
During the day's proceedings, videos the teenager accessed on Instagram were played to the court with the coroner once again warning the material had the ""potential to cause great harm"".
He said the content ""seeks to romanticise and in some way validate the act of harm to young people"", before urging anyone who wanted to leave the room to do so, with one person leaving.
When shown a note on Molly's phone which used the words ""I just want to be pretty"", Mr Sanders said the language was identical to a post the teenager had viewed on Instagram two days before.
""It's identical language... this is Instagram literally giving Molly ideas that she need to be concerned about her weight, correct?"" Mr Sanders asked.
Ms Lagone replied: ""I can't speak about what Molly may have been thinking.""
Referring to all the material viewed by the teenager the family considered to be ""encouraging"" suicide or self-harm, Mr Sanders continued: ""Do you agree with us that this type of material is not safe for children?""
Ms Lagone said policies were in place for all users and described the posts viewed by the court as a ""cry for help"".
Soon after the inquest began, Molly's father Ian Russell said he had been shocked by the ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" available for children to view online.
Mr Russell told the inquest much of the content seemed to ""normalise"" self-harm and suicide.
On Thursday, Pinterest's head of community operations, Judson Hoffman, apologised after  admitting the platform was ""not safe"" when the 14-year-old used it.
quest continues.

"/news/uk-england-birmingham-62580163","Businesses in Birmingham have called for government intervention in the face of the cost of living crisis.
At the wholesale market, one trader said rising prices meant he could not plan from one week to the next.
Official figures reveal that the cost of living is more than 10% higher than it was a year ago with the price of things like food and petrol soaring.
""There's nobody trying to help us,"" said market trader Leroy Howe, of Howe's Exports. 
""The price of fuel keeps going up so suppliers keep putting up the prices so what we find happening is that one week we'll be charged this price and the next week we'll be charged a higher price.""
He said he was already noticing fewer people the market as customers cut back on spending which he said was ""worrying"".
Mr Howe said he felt traders like him were being ""left to our own devices"" and ""aren't getting any support from anywhere"".
His concerns were echoed by Raj Kandola, head of policy at Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce.
""Many small businesses incurred huge debts in the pandemic which they are struggling to repay and now the cost of living crisis is adding to that pressure right now,"" he said.
""That's why we are calling on the government to act now and help alleviate these huge cost pressures firms are facing right now.""
Watch: Cost of living: ""A lot of people have nowhere to turn""
Mr Kandola said businesses were under pressure to raise their prices due to higher costs and called for financial support for people working in energy-intensive industries.
Nadhim Zahawi, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said the government would leave ""no stone unturned"" ahead of the incoming prime minister on 5 September.
""My message is... whether they are small businesses or families who are really struggling, really worried, is that we will be ready for more support as the new prime minister comes in,"" he said.

"/news/business-62299490","UK is set for the slowest growth of the G7 richest economies next year, the International Monetary Fund has warned.
It is predicting UK growth will fall to just 0.5% in 2023, much lower than its forecast in April of 1.2%.
global economy has shrunk for the first time since 2020, the IMF said, hit by the Ukraine war and Covid-19.
With growth stalling in the UK, US, China and Europe, the world ""may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession"", it said.
""We know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices, caused by global economic factors, triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" a HM Treasury spokesperson said in a statement, adding that help for households included £400 off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to £330 a year.
IMF has cut its 2022 global growth forecast to just 3.2% and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe.
It said fast-rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown, with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation.
""The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,"" economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body's latest economic forecast.
""The outlook has darkened significantly"" since April, the last time the IMF issued forecasts, he added.
global economy contracted in the three months to July, which was the first decline since the pandemic hit, the IMF said.
robability of a recession in the G7 economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - now stands at roughly 15% - nearly four times higher than usual.
While UK growth is expected to remain relatively strong this year, Mr Gourinchas said unusually high inflation - faster than in Europe or the US - is expected to take a toll in 2023.
""If you were to look at both years together, it's actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are,"" he told the BBC. ""The one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high. There is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy. 
""That would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the Bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward.""
IMF now expects inflation to reach 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies - nearly a full percentage point higher than it expected in April.
""Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers,"" Mr Gourinchas said.
""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship.""
fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world. Soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies - but it's the UK that, Russia apart, remains bottom of the pile for 2023. 
Brexit may not have helped but it's our reliance on fossil fuels - they make up 75% of our energy mix, more than in the EU  - that's made us particularly vulnerable to this shock. Those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all. This report comes on the day that, with the energy price cap set to top £3,000 in October, a committee of MPs warns that further government help for households may be needed.  
But the IMF is among those economists who've noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis, with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last 15 years, something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills, equipment and infrastructure. Officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise, not lower taxes, to fund more investment. 
US saw the steepest downgrade of any country for 2022. The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world's largest economy to 2.3% this year, from 3.7% previously, and to just 1% in 2023.
Meanwhile growth in China is expected to fall to 3.3% this year, the slowest rate in nearly four decades, as the country wrestles with new Covid lockdowns and a property crisis.
Questions about the reliability of Europe's natural gas supplies from Russia, as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices, are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead, the IMF said.
""We can be reasonably hopeful that China might be rebound,"" Mr Gourinchas said, adding that he was ""much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead"".
It warned that in a ""plausible"" scenario, in which only some of those risks materialise, like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, global economic growth could fall to 2% next year - a pace the world has fallen below just five times since 1970.","business","business"," politics

"/news/world-australia-63280853","Australian gambling giant Star Entertainment Group has been fined A$100m ($62m, £55m) for failing to stop money laundering at its Sydney casino.
group's licence to operate the casino has also been suspended.
Star has promised to ""do everything in [its] power"" to regain its licence and the community's trust.
Casino operators in Australia have been under great pressure to reform their gambling operations following reports of widespread criminal activity.
record penalties were announced in response to a damning inquiry in New South Wales (NSW) earlier this year.
It heard the Star had allowed money laundering and organised crime to infiltrate their Sydney casino, taking a ""cavalier"" approach to governance and at times making deliberate moves to cover its tracks.
At the time, the regulatory chief Philip Crawford said: ""The institutional arrogance of this company has been breathtaking.""
fine announced on Monday is the maximum allowed, but the NSW Independent Casino Commission stopped short of removing Star's licence altogether, to protect thousands of jobs.
Under the conditions of the suspension, the casino will still operate under a manager appointed by the regulator.
From Friday the Star will not be able to run the casino on its own until it can ""earn"" its licence back, Mr Crawford said.
A spokesman for The Star said the company is committed ""to charting a path back to suitability"".
It has previously promised to increase security staff, improve surveillance, end high-risk international VIP trips known as ""junkets"" and implement leadership changes.

Mr Crawford said the company's ""cultural issues"" would take time to stamp out, but it had showed signs it could reform under Mr Cooke's leadership.
Star entered a trading halt on Monday morning, which is set to last until Wednesday.
After a similar inquiry in Queensland, The Star was earlier this month also found unsuitable to run its three casinos in that state.
Media investigations have aired allegations of misconduct at various casinos around Australia in recent years, including at those owned by the country's largest gaming and entertainment group - Crown Resorts. 
It was fined $80 million by Victorian gambling authorities earlier this year for its failures to stop criminal activity.

"/sport/61644594","Olympic gold medallist Eve Muirhead has been named on the Queen's Birthday Honours list, alongside cricketer Moeen Ali and ex-footballer Rio Ferdinand.
Muirhead won curling gold at the Beijing Winter Olympics and has been made an OBE, while the rest of her team become MBEs.
Moeen and Ferdinand are both made an OBE, while Wales footballer Gareth Bale becomes an MBE.
Broadcaster Clare Balding and Tracey Crouch MP are both made CBEs.
round of honours are to mark the Queen's Jubilee Birthday celebrations to mark 70 years of service. 
Former sports minister Crouch chaired a fan-led review of football following a number of high-profile crises in the sport, such as the failed European Super League and the collapse of Bury FC. Its primary recommendation to create a new independent regulator for English football has been endorsed by the government.
Balding is recognised for her ability in front of the camera and her charity work. She holds ambassadorial positions with many organisations, including StreetVet and the Helen Rollason Cancer Charity.
Simpson brothers Neil and Andrew are also included on the list of MBEs after both winning gold at the Paralympic Games. 
Younger brother Neil, 19, was guided by brother Andrew, 21, to become GB's third-ever Winter Games gold medallist and the first male to achieve the feat after successes for Kelly Gallagher in 2014 and Menna Fitzpatrick in 2018.
Muirhead's rink defeated Japan to win Team GB's only gold medal in Beijing. Team-mates Vicky Wright, Jen Dodds, Hailey Duff and Mili Smith become MBEs, along with coach David Murdoch.
Scot Muirhead, 32, who has appeared at four Olympics, added to the bronze she won in Sochi in 2014.
England and Worcestershire all-rounder Moeen, 34, announced his retirement from Test cricket in September 2021 but has continued to play for the limited-overs side and was part of the Twenty20 team to reach the semi-finals of last year's World Cup.
He scored 2,914 runs and took 195 wickets in 64 Test matches, having made his debut against Sri Lanka in 2014.
undit and former Manchester United, Leeds, West Ham and England defender Ferdinand is honoured for services to football and charity. He set up the Rio Ferdinand Foundation this year, which works with young people and aids community development.
Snooker players Judd Trump and Mark Selby win recognition too. Former world champion Selby has become an advocate for mental health awareness after admitting his mental health struggles in January. Trump reached the final of this year's World Championship, losing to Ronnie O'Sullivan. 
Wigan Warriors and England rugby league legend Sean O'Loughlin is also included.
Others made an OBE include former England footballers Mike Summerbee and Luther Blissett, who starred for Manchester City and Watford respectively.
Wales and outgoing Real Madrid forward Bale won a joint-record fifth Champions League title on Saturday, albeit having barely featured this season. He spent last season on loan at former club Tottenham.
However, he won three La Liga titles, four Club World Cups, three Uefa Super Cups, one Copa del Rey and three Spanish Super Cups with Madrid, as well as helping Wales to two successive European Championships.
He is joined as an MBE by veteran Liverpool and former England midfielder James Milner.
In the past season Milner helped Liverpool win the FA Cup and League Cup, as well as reach the Champions League final.
Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers' Association, has also been made an OBE while former Scotland and Hibernian goalkeeper Alan Rough is an MBE.
Husband and wife Neil and Lora Fachie are MBEs after both winning Paralympic cycling gold within the space of 16 minutes.
Neil and pilot Matt Rotherham smashed their own world record to win gold in the B 1,000m time trial, before Lora and Corrine Hall successfully retained their B 3,000m pursuit crown.
Gaz Choudhry, who won Paralympic wheelchair basketball bronze and coached the team in Tokyo and Para-athlete Sammi Kinghorn, a Paralympic silver and bronze medallist, are both made MBEs.
Georgina Harland is also an MBE for her work as the first female chef de mission of the British Olympic Association for the Winter Olympics.
Swimmer Hannah Miley, who represented Britain in swimming at three Olympic Games and won the Commonwealth Games 400m individual medley titles in 2010 and 2014, has also been recognised with an MBE.
Muirhead brought watching British team-mates in the Ice Cube to their feet as she scored a superb four in the seventh end to effectively clinch the Olympic title.
Her performance was the more remarkable for her having returned from hip surgery.
She described the winning moment as a ""dream"" after emulating the gold won by Rhona Howie's team at Salt Lake City in 2002.
Muirhead said: ""There were times during this season that I would never have thought what I managed to go on and achieve was possible.
""I am absolutely delighted to be sharing this honour with my team-mates, because without them there's no way I could have been in this position.""
gold medal capped an incredible 12 months for Muirhead, who led Scotland to eighth at the World Championships last year.
After that disappointment nine players were put into a squad selection process and Muirhead, Wright, Dodds, and Duff emerged. They went on to win the European Championships in December before sealing their spot in Beijing in a tense qualifier just weeks before the Games.
Muirhead added: ""It just goes to show that the team around me never gives up and that you can accomplish anything if you set your mind to it.""
Moeen says he ended his Test career because he found the format ""really difficult to get into"" and ""really long"" - despite having an impressive career and being promoted to vice-captain.
ft-handed batter and off-spinner hit five centuries and took five five-wicket hauls in Tests, finishing with a batting average of 28.29 and a bowling average of 36.66.
Only 15 bowlers have taken more Test wickets for England and Moeen is ranked third among English spinners, behind Derek Underwood (297) and Graeme Swann (255).
""It's an honour to be recognised, it's amazing and my family are really proud and happy,"" he said. ""More than anything, I know it makes my parents happy.""
But he acknowledged his Pakistani heritage and Muslim faith had made him an ambassador for inclusivity in the sport too.
""It's not about runs and wickets. I think it's more about the journey I've been through. It's my background, my upbringing and all those kinds of things I've been through throughout my life.""
In 2017, Moeen became the fifth-fastest player in terms of matches played to reach 2,000 runs and 100 wickets, also taking a hat-trick against South Africa that year to seal a series win at The Oval.
He was part of the 2015 Ashes winning side but struggled during the 2017-18 series in Australia and took a break from cricket after being dropped during the 2019 Ashes at home.

"/news/entertainment-arts-63131425","BBC has reached a settlement with Earl Spencer's former head of security, after his bank statements were forged by Martin Bashir to help secure an interview with Princess Diana.
Alan Waller had claimed false documents were used to win the late princess's trust in an effort to encourage her to be interviewed on Panorama.
A 2021 inquiry led by Lord Dyson found Bashir acted in a ""deceitful"" way to secure an interview with Princess Diana. The corporation said it had now settled with Mr Waller.
""Following the publication of the Dyson Report last year, the BBC and Alan Waller, a former employee of the brother of Diana, Princess of Wales, today announce that a settlement has been reached between them,"" the corporation said in a statement published last Thursday.
""The BBC has agreed to pay Mr Waller an agreed sum in damages and to pay his reasonable costs, and apologises to him for the false information included in the fabricated bank statements used to procure the 1995 Interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. 
""The BBC hopes that Mr Waller is now able to draw a line under this chapter, and we wish him the best for the future.""
Mr Waller was left ""deeply distressed"" by Bashir's tactics, according to documents filed at the High Court. Mr Waller said his business ventures suffered when his name was linked to the scandal.
Bashir's interview with Princess Diana was broadcast by Panorama in late 1995, when she was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced.
More than 20 million people watched the programme. In it, the princess famously said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to the then Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles, whom he later married.
Following the publication of Lord Dyson's report last year, which strongly criticised the corporation, the BBC made an ""unconditional apology"" over the way the interview had been obtained.
BBC said the report identified ""clear failings"" and that while it now has better procedures in place, ""those that existed at the time should have prevented the interview being secured in this way"".","entertainment","politics"," politics

"/news/business-61375152","ue of Bitcoin has dropped below $31,000 (£25,140) - less than half of what it was at its peak last November, according to the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange.
fall of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value comes as stock markets around the world have also tumbled in recent days.
On Monday, key European, Asian and US indexes slid lower again.
Investors are fleeing riskier assets for safe havens like the dollar.
On Monday, Japan's Nikkei index dropped 2.5%, while London's FTSE 100 closed down more than 2%. In the US, the Dow fell nearly 2%, the S&P 500 dropped 3.2% and Nasdaq lost 4.3%, deepening the falls in recent weeks.
Uber was among the companies driving the declines.
Shares in the company dropped more than 11% on Monday after media outlets reported that chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi had warned staff that investors were becoming more cautious about investments. He said Uber would respond by cutting costs and slowing its hiring.
""It's clear that the market is experiencing a seismic shift and we need to react accordingly,"" he wrote in the letter.
""The average employee at Uber is barely over 30, which means you've spent your career in a long and unprecedented bull run. This next period will be different, and it will require a different approach.""
In times of market uncertainty traditional investors will often sell what they see as riskier assets - like digital currency - and move their money into safer investments.
Moves in cryptocurrency markets have increasingly followed wider trends, as professional investors, such as hedge funds and money managers, become more active in trading what was once the domain of individual investors and enthusiasts.
Bitcoin, which accounts for about a third of the cryptocurrency market with a total value of close to $570bn, has seen its price plunge more than 10% in the last day and more than 20% in the last week.
Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world, has also fallen in value, down by more than 20% in the last week.
Volatile trading in digital assets has not been unusual in previous years, but much of 2022 had been relatively quiet for the cryptocurrency market.
Last week, central banks around the world, including the US, UK and Australia, raised interest rates as they attempt to tackle rising prices.
US Federal Reserve raised its key lending rate by half a percentage point, marking its biggest rate hike in more than 20 years.
riggered more concerns among some investors that inflation and the higher cost of borrowing could have a major impact on global economic growth.
Investors are also worried about the impact of the war in Ukraine on the world economy.
Meanwhile, in the last year Bitcoin has become legal tender in two countries - El Salvador and the Central African Republic.
Since El Salvador said it would allow consumers to use the cryptocurrency in all transactions, alongside the US dollar, the International Monetary Fund has urged it to reverse its decision.

former TV executive was appointed to the role in May and in his first major speech since then, he underlined Ofcom's independence from ""personal preference"" and ""political pressure"".
He suggested public debate had descended into ""angry battlefields of bitter division"".
""Why does this matter to Ofcom?""
Lord Grade, who has previously held senior positions at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, made the comments during his keynote speech at the RTS London Convention 2022.
""Here, I want to be very clear: Ofcom does not, and should not, regulate the culture wars,"" he continued.
""Some try to conscript us to their cause. But we're not interested. That is not our job.""
He added: ""Whether we are judging that Piers Morgan's comments about the Duchess of Sussex were justified by freedom of expression, or that Diversity's tribute to the Black Lives Matter movement was, too - we never make decisions based on personal preference, political pressure, fear or favour.
""Instead, we all leave our various opinions at the door. We focus on the legal framework and duties given to us by Parliament, and make careful, balanced decisions based on the evidence.""
Before taking on his new role, Lord Grade criticised the BBC's coverage of Downing Street parties, describing it as ""gleeful and disrespectful"", and spoke in favour of the privatisation of Channel 4.
But speaking on Tuesday, the former Conservative peer - who has now moved to the crossbenches - said he would now put his ""personal opinions"" to one side while carrying out his new role.
""Our [Ofcom's] role is to provide research and evidence, to adapt our regulation and to inform Parliament about policy options and their impact,"" he said.
He said that long-term questions about Channel 4's ownership, BBC funding and how ""legislation might level the playing field where PSBs [public service broadcasters} compete with US streamers,"" were matters for the government, not Ofcom.
w Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said last week that she would ""re-examine the business case"" for privatising Channel 4.
Ms Donelan's predecessor Nadine Dorries had set out plans to take the broadcaster out of public ownership, as well as suggesting the next announcement about the BBC licence fee would be the last and that it was time to discuss new ways to fund and sell ""great British content"".
On Tuesday, Lord Grade asserted his view that public service broadcasters should be protected, noting their impact on the country's creative industries.
He also spoke about social media, something he has previously said he does not use himself.
Lord Grade told the audience that Ofcom should not seek ""to regulate the tone of debate on social media"", noting how he cared ""on a personal level"" about ""the need for tolerant debate"".
""That matters to me not just as a citizen and parliamentarian, but also as somebody who has sought to champion our world-class broadcasting sector,"" he said.
""Because broadcasting has a unique ability to provide a fair, accurate and trustworthy platform for calm, considered differences.
""Those views are more necessary than ever for a stable society and a strong democracy.""
BBC director general Tim Davie said last year it was harder than ever for the the corporation to maintain impartiality amid ""culture wars"" and a polarisation of online views.","entertainment","politics"," politics

"/news/entertainment-arts-63241308","Queen have revealed a previously unheard, deeply emotional song they recorded with Freddie Mercury in 1988.
Face It Alone, which the late singer recorded during sessions for 1989 album The Miracle, was given its premiere by BBC Radio 2's Ken Bruce on Thursday.
""We did find a little gem from Freddie, that we'd kind of forgotten about,"" drummer Roger Taylor said about the track in June.
""It's wonderful, a real discovery. It's a very passionate piece.""
g is one of six unreleased tracks to feature in a forthcoming box set of The Miracle, four of which feature Mercury's vocals.
A slow, sombre ballad, Face It Alone opens with a pounding drum and a finger-picked guitar line, before Mercury sings: ""When something so near and dear to life / Explodes inside / You feel your soul is set on fire.""
It was recorded during the historic sessions for The Miracle in London and Switzerland, when Mercury had been diagnosed with HIV but hadn't made it public.
In a powerful vocal, he appears to reference his failing health, growing increasingly passionate as he repeats the refrain: ""In the end / You have to face it all alone.""
Guitarist Brian May originally thought the recording was unsalvageable, but engineers proved him wrong. 
""It was kind of hiding in plain sight,"" he told Radio 2's Zoe Ball earlier this year. 
""We looked at it many times and thought, oh no, we can't really rescue that. But in fact, we went in there again and our wonderful engineering team went, 'OK, we can do this and this.' 
""It's like kind of stitching bits together... but it's beautiful, it's touching.""
One of more than 20 off-cuts from the sessions, Face It Alone is much darker than tracks like I Want It All and The Invisible Man, which eventually made it on to The Miracle.
um's closing track Was It All Worth It, however, dealt with similar themes, as the star reflected on his life and career and asked: ""Am I a happy man / Or is this sinking sand?""
Mercury died in November 1991, nine months after Queen's final album Innuendo - the successor to The Miracle - was released.
urviving group members reconvened in 1995 to record Made In Heaven, completing songs the singer had recorded before his death.
""new"" Queen music featuring Mercury's vocals came out eight years ago, when May and Taylor included the Michael Jackson duet There Must Be More to Life Than This on the 2014 Queen Forever compilation.
In 2019, a stripped-down version of Mercury's 1986 solo single Time was also released under the title Time Waits for No One.
Since 2011, the band have toured with American Idol star Adam Lambert, selling out stadiums across the world. Their 1981 Greatest Hits album is the UK's best-selling album of all time, with more than seven million copies sold.
Face It Alone is being released as a single on Thursday, with the Miracle box set following on 18 November. 
ght-disc collection will feature alternative takes and demos, alongside radio interviews and fly-on-the-wall recordings from the album sessions.
r unreleased tracks are When Love Breaks Up, You Know You Belong To Me, Dog With a Bone, Water and fan favourite I Guess We're Falling Out.
Several of those have circulated on bootlegs over the last 30 years, but this marks their first official release.

"/news/world-europe-63566579","UK and Switzerland are striking a deal on science collaboration as both countries continue to be blocked from a major EU scheme.
Political tensions mean the two nations have been shut out from the EU's multi-billion pound Horizon programme.
re are no fresh funds as part of the UK-Swiss deal.
But Swiss ambassador to the UK Markus Leitner described it as a ""political signal"" to researchers to deepen existing ties and find new projects. 
greement will be finalised on Thursday in London.
UK Science Minister George Freeman said: ""Being a science superpower means deepening our international relationships with leading research and development economies like Switzerland."" 
greement will focus on areas including artificial intelligence and turning academic discoveries into start-up businesses. 
UK and Switzerland have been trying to join the EU's key funding scheme for research and innovation, Horizon Europe, which has a budget of €95.5bn (£81.2bn) over the six years to 2027.
But the UK left the EU in January 2020 and membership of Horizon has been held up in a dispute about post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, with London accused of treaty breaches.
Switzerland has never been a member of the European Union, but has dozens of bilateral deals with Brussels instead. Full Swiss participation of Horizon has been blocked after Switzerland rejected plans for an overarching treaty with the EU. 
EU programme brings together leading academic and industrial researchers from across member nations. People based in third countries can participate but cannot usually lead projects or access EU funds.
Ambassador Markus Leitner said the UK-Swiss deal was ""separate"" from its efforts to join Horizon, which remained a ""priority"". 
UK's associate membership to Horizon was agreed in principle under a Brexit treaty, called the Trade and Co-operation Agreement. 
However, the European Commission has repeatedly pointed out that no binding deadline for association was specified within that agreement.
Resulting uncertainty for the sector and fears of a ""brain drain"" mean that ministers say they could soon pursue their own international scheme known as Plan B.
International agreements would form part of that alternative programme, along with new academic fellowships and funding for cutting-edge research. 
But universities have said reverting to Plan B would be a ""second-best"" outcome, while the scale of the Swiss deal is no match for Horizon. 
However, Mr Freeman told the BBC he plans more: ""This Anglo-Swiss agreement is the first of a number I am negotiating. I was recently in Israel, which will follow next."" 
f Universities UK International, Jamie Arrowsmith, welcomed the Swiss deal but said the interests of everybody including global science would be ""best served by all parties agreeing to remove political impediments, and proceeding to ratify UK and Swiss association to Horizon Europe"".
re are jitters within the science and research community that the Treasury could seek to cut the £15bn that was earmarked for Horizon.  
Billions of pounds worth of public spending cuts are expected by the Conservative government on 17 November. ","politics","politics"," politics

"/news/business-61793198","Major tampon manufacturers in the United States have pledged to make more of the sanitary products to address shortages in the country.
One firm told the BBC the pandemic had caused staff shortages at its plants.
Social media users have been posting about their experiences as they struggle to find sanitary products.
One Reddit user said they visited eight stores to find tampons with a cardboard applicator, before deciding to buy them online ""at a noticeable mark-up"".
It comes as the war in Ukraine is making the raw materials used in sanitary products more costly.
rtage is also adding to concerns that supply chain disruptions could further push up prices for essential goods around the world.
A spokesperson for Edgewell Personal Care, which makes Playtex and o.b. tampons, said that its stocks have been ""impacted due to extensive workforce shortages caused by two separate Omicron surges in the US and Canada in late 2021 and early 2022, respectively"".
""We have been operating our manufacturing facilities around the clock to build back inventory and anticipate returning to normal levels in the coming weeks,"" the spokesperson added.
Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble (P&G), the maker of the Tampax tampon brand, said in a statement that it was ""working hard to ramp up production"".
""We can assure you this is a temporary situation,"" said the company, which sells around 4.5bn boxes of tampons globally each year. 
P&G's chief financial officer, Andre Schulten, said at a recent earnings call that it has been ""costly and highly volatile"" to acquire raw materials such as cotton and plastic for tampons.
""It is so important at this point for people to buy only what they need. I am not a supply chain expert but we know that some of the shortages we all experienced early in the pandemic were due to hoarding,"" Elise Joy, the co-founder and executive director of US charity Girls Helping Girls Period, said.
""Menstrual products are not a luxury item, and if we all take or buy what we need it will go a long way to making sure more people can get basic supplies,"" she added.
A spokesperson for the US pharmacy chain Walgreens told the BBC that it was ""experiencing some temporary brand-specific tampon shortage in certain geographies"". 
""While we will continue to have products at shelf and online, it may only be in specific brands while we navigate the supply disruption,"" the spokesperson added.

"/news/health-63569463","Almost one out of every three people infected with HIV through contaminated NHS blood products in the 1970s and 80s was a child, research has found.
About 380 children with haemophilia and other blood disorders are now thought to have contracted the virus. 
w estimate was produced by the public inquiry into the disaster, after a BBC News report into the scandal.
In August, the government agreed to pay survivors and the partners of those who died compensation.
first interim payments of £100,000 per person were made last month. 
greement does not cover bereaved parents or the children of those who have died. 
A wider announcement on compensation is expected when the inquiry concludes, next year.
Between 1970 and 1991, 1,250 patients with blood disorders were infected with HIV in the UK when given Factor VIII - a new treatment that replaced the clotting protein missing from their blood.
About half died before life-saving antiretroviral drugs became available.
f thousands of others are believed to have been exposed to hepatitis, which can cause liver failure and cancer, through the same treatment or a blood transfusion.
Previous estimates for the number of children infected were based on documents referenced in the national archives. 
files, from November 1990, showed at least 175 children infected with HIV had qualified for a financial settlement after bringing a legal action against the Department of Health.
But after BBC News reported that figure, in October, staff at the public inquiry worked to produce a more accurate estimate. 
And they have now concluded, based on three separate sources, about 380 children were infected.
When the new estimate was read out at the public inquiry, there was an audible gasp from some survivors and relatives.
Richard Warwick was infected with HIV and two forms of hepatitis as a young boy. 
He was one of more than 120 pupils with haemophilia at Treloar College, a specialist boarding school in Hampshire, in the 1970s and 80s. 
At least 72 of them died after being given contaminated blood products at a centre run by NHS staff on the school site.
""We lost so many friends from Treloar's - it was absolutely heartbreaking,"" Mr Warwick told BBC News. 
His medical records show he first tested positive for HIV in December 1984, aged 19, but was not told about the diagnosis for another three years. 
""We have now been bombarded with so many horrible statistics that it gets to the point where it starts to wash over you,"" he said. 
""We can't bring those friends back - but we can still try and get answers for the families of the children who have died.""
UK was not self-sufficient in blood products in the 1970s and 80s, so Factor VIII concentrate was often imported from the United States.
Each batch was made from the blood plasma of thousands of donors. 
Drug companies in the US paid donors - including some in high-risk groups, such as prisoners and drug users.
And if just one was HIV positive, the virus could be transmitted.
Haemophilia Society chief executive Kate Burt said: 'We know that some very young children with bleeding disorders were given high-risk factor-concentrate treatment from mid-1983 onwards, which went against guidance at the time. 
""As a result, some parents have had to live with the unbearable question of whether their child's death or infection could have been prevented.""

"/news/business-61637028","Filling the tank of a diesel car now typically costs more than £100 after fuel prices hit record levels.
rage price of diesel in the UK rose to 182.59p a litre on Sunday, according to the AA.
At the same time, petrol hit a new record of 172.73p a litre, it said.
rises mean drivers will pay more at the pump ahead of half-term getaways or trips over the four-day Platinum Jubilee bank holiday which begins on Thursday.
Filling the average 55-litre tank with diesel costs £100.42 and petrol £95, the AA said.
RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: ""With crude oil prices consistently above $115 a barrel last week, worse is sadly yet to come, just in time for the Jubilee bank holiday"".
He said petrol was now more expensive than diesel to wholesalers, so retailers were taking smaller margins on petrol but larger ones on diesel.
""If the wholesale price of petrol stays above diesel, we ought to see the current 10p-a-litre gap in average petrol and diesel forecourt prices narrow,"" he said.
""If this doesn't happen diesel drivers will be getting a raw deal, and with prices at these historic highs, every penny matters to drivers.""
rice of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - has soared in recent months, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of potential global supply issues.
Fuel prices had already been rising after economies reopened from coronavirus lockdowns, prompting a surge in demand.
A month ago, diesel across the UK averaged 176.47p a litre and 131.64p a litre a year ago, the AA said. Meanwhile petrol a month ago cost an average of 162.40p a litre and 129.31p a year ago, it added.
""With the cost of filling up now above £100, what had once been a 'dash for diesel' among UK car owners is rapidly becoming the death of diesel,"" said Luke Bosdet, the AA's spokesman on pump prices.
""Diesel's new record price is the latest nail in the coffin of the diesel car, after it had been demonised for its emissions in an urban environment. 
""However, a diesel car's 15%-20% better fuel consumption compared to a petrol equivalent out on the open road means less CO2 emissions and would make it more attractive were it not for the current higher cost of refuelling,"" Mr Bosdet said.","business","business"," business

"/news/health-63998488","Royal College of Nursing could announce a fresh wave of strikes if Health Secretary Steve Barclay does not agree to reopen pay negotiations. 
Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, the union's leader Pat Cullen said if the government continued to refuse to ""get in a room and talk"" then the dispute could escalate in the new year. 
UK government says the union's demands are unaffordable.
Nurses are already planning to strike on Tuesday. 
f thousands of nurses took industrial action across England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Thursday, with tens of thousands of patient appointments cancelled or postponed.
Union sources have told the BBC that if there is no move to reopen pay talks, then new strike dates will be announced before Christmas with a series of walkouts likely in January. 
f disruption could also increase, with nurses striking across more NHS trusts in England and for longer periods of time - perhaps over two consecutive days. Industrial action is also taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland. 
NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, has urged ministers to act to avoid strikes in the new year which it said could be ""more severe"" and coordinated with other health unions. 
government said the nurses' demands for a 19% pay rise are unaffordable and it has followed the recommendation of an independent pay review body in setting wages.
Nurses got an extra 3% last year after the pandemic and another rise recommended by a pay review body.
Speaking outside a hospital in London on Thursday, the UK health secretary said the government was ""hugely grateful"" to nurses but the 19% pay rise they wanted was ""not affordable given the many other economic pressures that we face"".
Mr Barclay said three-quarters of trusts had not gone on strike that day and many nurses had continued working in areas excluded from the strike because of the risk to life.
Under strike rules, emergency care must still be provided during action, for example in intensive care and A&E, and urgent cancer treatment and dialysis should run as normal - which means the biggest impact will have been on routine services. These include planned knee and hip replacements and out-patient appointments.
Rebecca, a nurse striking outside St Thomas' Hospital in London on Thursday, said her job was ""too tiring, it's too much, it's just not safe for either the staff or the patients to continue the way it is now"".
Under-staffing was a major concern for Kelly Hopkins, who has been a nurse for 25 years in Liverpool, as well as the financial struggles of her colleagues.
""They're having to use food banks, they're coming in cold, they're going without food to feed their children, it's just crazy,"" she said.
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
In England and Wales, most NHS staff have received a pay rise of roughly £1,400 this year - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
uation in Northern Ireland meant there was a delay in processing the increase - but nurses should receive backdated payments before the end of the financial year.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) wants a larger rise, of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at 14%, saying its members have received years of below-inflation pay increases.
government says it has followed the recommendation of the independent NHS Pay Review Body, which said in July NHS staff should receive the £1,400 increase, with slightly more for the most experienced nurses.
RCN has criticised this body for not being independent enough. It is made up mainly of economists and human resources professionals.
Welsh ministers said they were unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
In Scotland, the RCN's strike action was ""paused"" after ministers made a fresh offer worth just over £2,200, or 7.5%, a year for most NHS staff. Nurses have been asked to vote on that deal, with results due next week. ","health","politics"," politics

"/news/uk-62713645","Beauty pageants can have a reputation as glitzy, glamorous events where young women are cloaked in a thick layer of make-up. 
first part may still be true, but Melisa Raouf is on a mission to change the second. 
20-year-old student will be the first person to compete in the final of the Miss England contest without make-up in its nearly 100-year history, in a bid to show girls they don't have to wear it to feel beautiful. 
Ms Raouf, from south London, won a special ""bare-face"" round of the competition last week, cementing her place in the final between 40 contestants on 17 October.
But while previous winners of this round have returned to wearing make-up for the final, she will not. 
And if she wins, she says she will will leave it off for the Miss World competition, hoping to ""inspire the world"". 
""I wanted to prove we have a choice,"" she tells BBC News. ""We don't have to wear make-up if we don't want to.""
Like many of her peers, Ms Raouf began wearing make-up in her teens.
She says she was ""significantly insecure"", and found comparing herself to the ""unrealistic standard of beauty"" shown on social media had a negative impact on her mental health. 
""I never felt comfortable in who I was, never felt comfortable in my skin,"" Ms Raouf says. 
But as she got older she gained confidence - and she thinks taking part in the beauty pageant, while ""very daunting"" at the time, has increased this. 
""I just thought, I'm doing this for all of us.""
Since last week's bare-face round, Ms Raouf says she has been ""overwhelmed"" by positive messages on social media. 
""I've heard from girls of all ages, from women in their 40s and 50s, saying they feel more comfortable in their own skin,"" she says. 
Ms Raouf does not object to wearing make-up in general, and will still do so on other occasions. She wore some skin products allowed by the bare-face round, including toner, moisturiser and lip balm. 
""I appreciate make-up as a form of art and creativity,"" she says. 
""It's ok to wear make up to enhance your looks or for special occasions, but it shouldn't define us. It's about the choice.
""I wanted to prove we don't have to wear make-up if we don't want to.""
Ms Raouf wants girls to place more value on their ""inner beauty"" rather than comparing themselves to others.
""When you wear that amount of make-up you're just concealing yourself. Remove all those layers and you'll see who you truly are,"" she adds. 
Miss England, which is owned by the Miss World competition, is one of four beauty pageants from each of the UK nations which sends a contestant to the global event each year. 
Miss World was first organised in 1951 in the UK by television host Eric Morley. His widow, Julia Morley, became CEO after his death in 2000. 
franchise has faced some criticism over claims it objectifies women, most famously in 1970 when members of the Women's Liberation Movement used flour to disrupt the Miss World final at London's Royal Albert Hall.
re were also protests, from various groups including the London Feminist Network and UK Feminista, when the competition final was held in London in 2011 and 2014. 
Some of the rules of entry for the competition have not been changed since 1951. 
Miss England hopefuls cannot be older than 27 in their year of entry, and are not allowed to be married or have given birth to children. 
In 2018, Veronika Didusenko, who had been crowned Miss Ukraine, said the rules needed to change after she had her title taken away for being a mother. 
Julia Morley later said it was difficult to alter entry rules as local competitions took place in so many different countries. 
But for Ms Raouf, the events are a ""positive and inspiring"" influence.
""The contestants use their platform to do something good in the world.""
Ms Raouf, who is in the second year of her politics degree at King's College London, wants to enter diplomacy after her studies.
She says the women competing alongside her have a more varied range of interests and backgrounds than is often portrayed.
""Everyone has their own story,"" she says.","entertainment","entertainment"," entertainment

Prosecutors believe that Terraform Labs, which is registered in Singapore, had violated capital market rules.
rra Luna lost 99% of its value in May and this was aggravated by a fall of its sister token, TerraUSD.
Mr Kwon did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on Thursday.
A spokesperson for the South Korea prosecutor's office told the BBC that arrest warrants had been issued for Kwon and five other individuals connected to the case. However, she declined to comment on how close authorities were to making the arrests.
According to media reports Mr Kwon is believed to be in Singapore, which does not have an extradition agreement with South Korea.
Mr Kwon said it was ""kind of hard"" to decide whether to return to South Korea in a recent interview with crypto show Coinage.
He also claimed to have ""never been in touch with the investigators"".
Prosecutors are planning to arrest and extradite Mr Kwon from Singapore by nullifying his passport and working with international policing organisation Interpol, the Financial Times reported.
Neither Interpol nor Singapore Police responded to a BBC request for comment.

"/news/uk-scotland-61873877","Harriet Ross says rising costs are a huge worry for pig farmers
Harriet Ross admits to having days where she's sick of farming. Pig sick.
She is trying to run a pig farm at Newburgh in Aberdeenshire but costs and overheads are getting out of control.
Her farm aims to grow enough barley to feed the pigs in all seasons but this year it ran out almost six months early.
Harriet points to a range of factors including Brexit, coronavirus and the war in Ukraine which have created difficulties which are pushing her business to the brink.
Young piglets have to be kept in temperature-controlled rooms all year round so rising electricity prices are having a crippling effect on the business.
""Welfare of the pigs is the number one priority so we need to make sure that (the temperature) is at the right level for them and we need electricity to do that,"" she says.
Harriet's energy bill has just doubled from £60,000 a year to about £132,000.
But that's not even her biggest overhead. About 70% of the cost of running the farm is feed.
Harriet and her partner Ben have tried to create a circular system where they grow enough barley to feed the animals in all seasons.
But a shortage of migrant workers at the abattoir created a backlog in processing the pigs, meaning they had to keep them on farm for longer.
xtra mouths quickly ate through the grain store which ran out back in March.

She says the harvest will be ""quite a big relief but actually paying for the fuel (for the machinery) won't be.""
few months have brought sleepless nights as they try to buy cereals for the pigs to eat.
While prices have been extremely high, the biggest difficulty has been getting hold of it.

At just 30, Harriet only became a full-time farmer last year when she took over her parents' arable business.
Around the same time, a neighbouring pig farm went on the market and so she took on that too.

""In the middle of the night I'll wake up and check the bank account,"" she admitted.
Rising input costs - from feed to fertiliser - are having a huge impact on farmers across the country.  
As the Royal Highland show takes place at Ingliston near Edinburgh, the biggest showcasing farming and rural life in Scotland, NFU Scotland said overheads for farmers were reaching unprecedented levels.
It said the situation had created a ""cash flow crisis"" and the Scottish government has agreed to bring forward the date for issuing farm payments from October to September.
NFU commissioned a survey of members which says many are already reducing the size of their farms.
In the pig sector, sow numbers are decreasing by about 30% while beef cattle and ewe numbers are being cut by 38%.
NFU Scotland President Martin Kennedy said: ""These results must serve as a wake-up call and move food security to the top of the political agenda.  
""Reductions in agricultural production on this scale, if replicated across our whole industry, will have significant ramifications for our food and drink sector and all those businesses upstream and downstream who rely on farmers and crofters.""
But a report by Scotland's Food Security and Supply task force has said there is no immediate threat.
It has recommended that the Scottish Government set up a Food Security Unit to monitor potential future threats, such as from climate change.","business","business"," business

"/news/uk-63383616","Rishi Sunak is the UK's third prime minister in less than two months - the fifth in six years. It is the fastest turnover of leaders in No 10 for nearly a century.
Since the summer of 2007, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Mr Sunak have all held the top office. In contrast, there were just three prime ministers in the 28 years before - Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair.
What is the cause of the revolving door at No 10? And could this trend be the new normal for British politics? 
Jill Rutter, from the think tank the Institute for Government, believes the Brexit vote in 2016 has been the number one destabilising factor in British politics over the last six years.
""We can attribute almost all of the instability to a fallout of the Brexit referendum and what it has done to the Conservative Party,"" she says.
""David Cameron was a long-serving prime minister. Had he not had the referendum, he could have been on track till 2018 and would have handed over to either George Osborne or Boris Johnson.
""He was derailed by calling the referendum. It was a tactical error not to go all-out for the victory and thinking victory was in the bag,"" she adds.
Mr Cameron's resignation after six years in office paved the way for Theresa May. She spent three years and 11 days in office, while her successor, Boris Johnson, spent three years and 44 days at the helm.
""Theresa May was clearly brought trouble by a twin combination - the disastrous election in 2017 and the fact that she and the party could not agree what Brexit meant,"" Ms Rutter adds.
She says the Conservative Party ""thought Boris Johnson could break the Brexit deadlock, but one of the ways he did that was by not paying much attention to norms and rules"".
""It was his failure to do this that brought him down. It meant his ministers could not take it anymore. They'd gone for somebody in desperation.""
Liz Truss's shorter premiership at barely seven weeks was, according to Ms Rutter, a direct legacy of the referendum. 
""The membership had changed quite a bit,"" she explains. ""They were ready for the message about ignoring orthodoxy. But they discovered when they went hell for leather against conventional wisdom, they fell over in a heap.""
Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College in London, agrees. 
""The referendum has destabilised British politics,"" he says. ""The difficulty has been to find the right relationship with Europe.""
But is it really all about Brexit?
m Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, believes the trend could be something that runs much deeper.
He points to what he calls the ""presidentialisation"" of the UK's parliamentary system, or the greater focus on party leaders, as one of the reasons that prime ministers' terms are not lasting as long.
""There is far more focus from voters and politicians on party leaders and rather less on the party as a whole - that means that the leader is often held personally responsible for anything that goes wrong,"" he says.
""It is now pretty much impossible for a party leader to lead his or her party [after] an election defeat,"" he explains, adding that former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was the notable exception to the rule in 2017.
Aged 42, Rishi Sunak is the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. He has risen through the ranks of the Conservative Party in the space of just seven years since he was first elected as an MP in 2015. 
""MPs can come into parliament and very quickly gain a name for themselves,"" Prof Bale says.
""That has destabilised parliamentary politics. It used to be quite hierarchical, but MPs are generally impatient to move up the ladder but also if they think things are not working they would be piling onto Twitter and the rolling news channels to say 'something needs to change - and that includes the leader'.""
Prof Bale believes the rise of social and digital media has also made a big difference to how voters view politicians. 
In the past, ""politicians were not faceless,"" he says, ""but they were not the celebrities they are now. That feeds through to how voters view politics.""
Prof Bogdanor disagrees. The governments of David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill during the two world wars, William Gladstone in the 19th century, and more recently Margaret Thatcher could all be described as ""presidential,"" he argues.
""Governments have always been presidential,"" he says. ""The power of the prime minister ebbs and flows really with their electoral position."" 
Prof Bogdanor believes Mr Sunak might now usher in a period greater stability.
""I cannot see him being overthrown in the next two years. There is going to be economic hardship, but the Conservatives have two years until the next general election.""
But Patrick Dunleavy, emeritus professor of political science and public policy at the London School of Economics, believes an election will be held before the two-year deadline.
""I do not think that the two years is a credible timeline now,"" he says, arguing that pinch points for Mr Sunak include the local council elections next year and then his anniversary in office, depending on his opinion poll ratings.
Prof Dunleavy also sees the problem in other Westminster-style systems. Australia, which is also a parliamentary system, has had nine prime ministers in 12 years, owing in part to what are called spill elections. It has led to Australia being dubbed ""coup capital of the democratic world""..
Leadership spills occur when members of the parliamentary party feel that the leader is taking them in the wrong direction, or not delivering on the promises made to those who elected them, and does not have the numbers to back their position.
""The Conservative Party has moved over to full spill election operations. They were threatening Cameron in 2016, they were used against May - she survived the first one then she had to give up - they were used against Boris and then against Truss,"" Prof Dunleavy says.
""Spill elections are definitely here in the UK.""

"/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63498226","Deputy First Minister John Swinney has detailed £1.2bn of cuts from the Scottish government's budget for the current year, as inflation continues to wreak havoc on public finances.
What is the money needed for, where is it coming from, and are more cuts on the horizon?
mergency budget review started out as an exercise to find extra cash for cost of living measures, to help households deal with rising prices and bills.
But even as it was being considered, the government's own budget was hit by a tidal wave of inflation which wiped £1.7bn of spending power off the plans out less than a year ago.
It also meant public sector workers understandably clamoured for better pay deals, which have cost far more than originally budgeted - some £700m has been put aside, and negotiations with many unions are ongoing amid talk of strikes.
In a way pay deals are the ultimate cost of living measure, as they put money directly into the pockets of workers - but they still need to be paid for from a pot of cash that also covers frontline services.
And this is all just the 2022-23 budget we're talking about - the Scottish government has to balance its books on an annual basis, and can't just carry over some debts into the next financial year. So some cuts have had to be made straight away.
re is an extent to which money can be found by shifting things around within the budget.
An example is that fewer people than expected signed up for the concessionary travel scheme - there is less demand, and thus less money needs to be spent. Mr Swinney was able to claw back £37.6m from the budget, and unless there's an unexpected spike in applications for bus passes, the public won't notice any difference.
re are lots of examples of this, and of costs that can safely be booted into future years, such as money that hasn't yet been spent on delayed college-building schemes that can be dealt with later, or spending on City Deal projects that has moved further down the road.
w the government's budget differs from a household one, for all that they're both being hit by inflationary pressures. Households can't reprofile funds from capital budgets into revenue ones.
But there are only so many of these fiscal conjuring tricks that can be played and there's only so much fat you can trim before you start cutting into the bone.
So some of the cutbacks announced this week are coming from real, tangible areas. Efforts are being made to protect the most critical frontline services, but ultimately people are eventually going to start noticing changes on the ground.
One way of selling cuts is to make them to budgets that were already increasing - like that for mental health - so you can contend that they are just not rising as quickly as planned, rather than falling outright.
It might make £65m cuts to primary care improvement funds sound more palatable when it can be badged as a ""reduction in the planned growth rate"". 
But at the end of the day it is still less money for a core portfolio, and at a stage in the year when managers will have made plans for the bulk of their allocated budget.
What isn't known yet is how this will actually translate into reduced services on the ground.
When £116m comes out of the budget for Covid vaccinations, PPE and contact tracing, what does that actually mean at your local vaccine centre?
Are queues for jabs going to get longer? Will there be less face masks and gloves to go around? Or is there an extent to which money can be found down the back of a metaphorical sofa in a mothballed testing lab?
It's not clear from the documents published by the government, and it probably won't be clear to frontline staff on the ground yet either.
me goes for mental health and primary care - the detail of where precisely the cash will come from may not have translated all the way through to local clinics yet.
recent fiscal flip-flopping at Westminster has certainly caused uncertainty when it comes to drawing up plans at Holyrood.
At the height of mini-budget mania, it looked as if the Scottish Parliament's block grant might actually grow by £660m over three years, on account of the huge giveaways planned by Kwasi Kwarteng.
After the pendulum swung the other way under Jeremy Hunt, ministers are now expecting a £230m reduction in funding over that same period.
ffect for 2022-23 is actually still a £35m increase in the devolved budget, thanks to changes to stamp duty down south.
But nobody is expecting the longer-term figures to stand still, with Mr Hunt warning of difficult choices to come in his Autumn Statement on 17 November.
Chancellor makes will have a direct impact on Holyrood's block grant, both in terms of tax levels and spending limits for departments. The forecasts produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility will also be key.
All of that will play into Mr Swinney's own budget announcement on 15 December, when he will be able to make tax changes of his own.
We seem to have moved with dizzying speed from talk of tax cuts boosting growth to tax rises and service cuts being priced in.
re is a measure of political choice in this, of course - there are tax levers ministers have so far declined to pull, like the idea of a beefed-up windfall tax.
Income tax rises are broadly expected, but big hikes are not palatable to a Conservative government - particularly one led by a man who was dreaming of a 16% basic rate in the summer.
Scottish government too has talked about protecting those at the lower end of the income scale, at the same time as their advisors have warned against making big changes to the higher rates.
Departments in Scotland were already braced for real-terms cuts in any case, having been given a fairly grim outlook by Kate Forbes in her Resource Spending Review in May.
finance secretary - currently on maternity leave - was issuing warnings about the need to reset the public sector before inflation had blown a hole in the budget.
figures she set out are what have led to talk around Holyrood of the police service being ""hollowed out"", of courthouses having to close and the 101 phone line being cut off.
Mr Swinney now says the outlook is ""clearly even more difficult"" than when Ms Forbes drew up those plans, adding that ""measures for efficiency and reform in the delivery of our public services will be even more important"".

"/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-59294720","When Mike Mitchell started his journey through the karate belts at the age of 69, he found himself competing at events full of children.
He was many decades older than the other students, and during one grading he even considered leaving.
""I was surrounded by children who had higher grades than me and 50 parents watching from the balcony, and I felt like running away,"" he said.
But Mike forced himself to overcome his embarrassment - and has become the oldest man to obtain a Japanese Karate Association (JKA) black belt in Scotland.
""There was nobody there as old as me at the gradings,"" said the former PE teacher.
""I felt embarrassed that people were watching but didn't know who I was or why I was there.""
Now after five years and thousands of hours of training, the 74-year-old has achieved the first dan grade.
While there are older people with black belts, they achieved them when they were decades younger. No-one else has achieved a JKA black belt in Scotland while in their 70s.
Mike, who has three children and two grandchildren, lives in Haddington, East Lothian, with his wife of 52 years, Gloria.
He said he had been on ""an endless search to prove myself to myself"", with previous interests including mountain climbing and badminton.
""I would hope the next mountain climb, or badminton competition, would be my masterpiece,"" he said.
""But it wasn't until I got my black belt that I realised I had been released from this and that I had achieved my masterpiece.
""I had been fighting all my life to prove myself. I didn't know why I was doing it at the time, but now I feel like an inspiration to my family - and I feel relief.""
Mike was well into his 70s when he started training with brown and black belts.
""During one of the sessions I was fighting a black belt and suddenly I was on the floor and I couldn't breathe.
""I hadn't been winded since I was a child, but that is what it was. He had swept my front leg with his, and dumped me on the floor, end of fight.
""After that I started to change my fighting style.""
When he went for his black belt last month, Mike was told he might not be allowed to do the fighting part of the grading.
""They were concerned I could have a heart attack or get really beaten up due to my age,"" he said.
However, he begged his instructor to ask if he could fight and was allowed to do so - against an opponent who was about half his age.
Mike said his style had evolved since the earlier fight when he was winded.
""When someone attacks you, your instinct is to move back - but if you move in just at the moment they initiate an attack it can be very effective, particularly if you have long levers, which I have.
""So he stepped in, I stepped in and stopped him in his tracks. It happened twice more.
""I think he was getting what they were afraid I would get.""
When the contest was over, Mike had achieved his black belt - which he described as ""an extraordinary moment"".
He now plans to spend the next two years training for his second dan.
Paola Burrows, his instructor at the JKA Bass rock Club in Gullane, said Mike was ""a great fighter and an inspiration"".
""People think that if you go to enough lessons you will become a black belt, but it just doesn't work like that,"" she said.
""You have to prove you are worthy of a black belt and Mike did more than this at his first dan grading.
""He was up against an opponent much younger than him who was incredibly shocked when Mike stopped him dead several times."" ","sports","sports"," sports

"/news/business-63542786","At family-owned food shop Popat Mithai & Farsan, owner Vijaya Popat and her all-female team are often so busy dealing with customers in multiple languages that there's barely time to sit down, let alone chat with a nosy journalist.
Mrs Popat set up the business in Leicester back in 2011 to sell Indian sweets and savouries, and it has grown from two members of staff to 15 today. And an online operation was launched in 2018.
Serving the South Asian diaspora in the East Midlands city and further afield, sales soared during the coronavirus pandemic, as customers sought more comfort food - the tastes that they or their forebears brought to the UK from countries including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Mrs Popat's son Shyam was put forward to speak to the BBC. ""My mum is widely known in the community as being the person that runs the business,"" he says.
""And they all want to speak to her specifically to see if she can source particular things.""
He adds that it's not just first generation immigrants, or those who have just moved to the UK recently, that make up the core customer base. Instead it is also the second generation, who might be buying food for their families, and increasingly online.
""During the lockdowns the website was a total lifesaver, and now we're out of lockdown it has become a thriving arm of the business in itself,"" says Shyam Popat. ""Online sales now account for approximately one-quarter to one-third of the entire turnover of the business.""
In addition to importing products from South Asia, the shop also buys from Kenya.
world's diasporas give to trade between countries is difficult to quantify, but governments are increasingly aware of the economic importance of migrant populations and their descendants.
Kenya announced in September that it would be creating a new ministry for Kenyans living abroad, and US President Joe Biden has announced that he will tell next month's US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington that he wishes to ""amplify diaspora ties"".
But just how big are the world's diasporas? There are currently 281 million people who live in a country other than the one in which they were born, according to the 2022 World Migration Report from the United Nation's International Organization for Migration (IOM).
umber equates to 3.6% of the global population, or one in 30 people. And it doesn't include any children those people have that are born in their new country, nor does it include the descendants of former migrants.
For this reason, the IOM defines the terms ""migrants"" and ""diasporas"" (which comes from the Greek to scatter) separately. The later also including descendants of former migrants ""whose identity and sense of belonging, either real or symbolic, have been shaped by their migration experience and background"". 
quates to billions of people, but an exact number is very difficult to quantify given that it is determined by a person's cultural identity. Even the IOM said back in 2020 that ""currently there are no attempts to measure global diaspora populations per se"".
More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.
What is certain, is that the entrepreneurial drive within migrant populations has long been recognised. A 2010 report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said that immigrant entrepreneurs were better educated than their native counterparts, and more likely to create a new business.
And often those firms are involved in the importation of food, clothing or other goods from a migrant's former country, such as Indian-born Vijaya Popat and her thriving shop in Leicester. The store, and others like it, played their part in India's exports to the UK totalling $10.4bn last year.
Based in Paris, Olivier Habiyambere is helping to boost Kenyan exports to Europe. He is the founder of website Kenyan Diaspora Market, which imports food and clothing in bulk from the African country, and then sells it to customer across the European continent.
Mr Habiyambere, who was raised in Kenya, came up with the idea for the business when he moved to Paris to study and met others from Kenya and East Africa.
""Everybody wanted Kenyan products, but the issue was bringing the products from Kenya to here,"" he says. ""People could pick up the products when they went to Kenya, but it's not like they could do that every year.""
So he launched the business in April 2022 to offer Kenyans in Europe an easier way of buying products from home. Mr Habiyambere adds that business has grown steadily, helped by Kenyan communities spreading the word via WhatsApp groups.
While Kenyan Diaspora Market is focused on Kenyan migrants, Glasgow-based website Agora Greek Delicacies now has more non-Greek customers than those from within the UK's Greek communities. 
It was set up a decade ago by husband and wife Christina Lyropoulou and Michael Sofianos, who had gone to university in the UK. They now employ 14 people and supply imported Greek food and drink to restaurants, cafes, individuals, and other businesses.
""We started expanding to the British audience - so those travelling to Greece or had Greek friends,"" says Ms Lyropoulou. ""And our online shop saw an increase in sales of about 1000% in the first months of the lockdown.""
Prof Pragya Agarwal, a behavioural and data scientist at the University of Loughborough, regularly buys products originating from her native India for herself and her family in the UK.
""For me personally, it's about maintaining the connection with the motherland, the fatherland - whatever you call it,"" she says.
She laughs as she describes her love of Indian mangos, and admits she regularly would regularly order from a particular store online in a bid to get her mango fix, especially during the pandemic.
""It's what I used to eat growing up in India every summer - every day after every meal.""
Maria Elo, is an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark who has a number of books and articles on diaspora and trade.
She says it's important to be aware of the framing that occurs whenever diaspora is discussed, with migrants often described in one of two ways. 
One narrative is that migration and diaspora are problematic. Prof Elo describes that as a ""deficit view"" with negative connotations. But she adds there is also a positive narrative, which involves ""a big promise for business and economy"".
She adds that research shows that diaspora entrepreneurs are agile, and encourage cross-over products. ""We all eat pizza today, although we're not all Italians and that is something that crossed over a long time ago.""","technology","business"," business

"/news/uk-politics-61604784","UK is to sign its first trade agreement with an individual US state, with more expected this year as it attempts to show post-Brexit progress.
Memorandum of Understanding with Indiana seeks to boost the £1.1bn ($1.4bn) worth of goods the state already buys from the UK.
rade Minister Ranil Jayawardena will sign the agreement with the Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb on Friday.
But opposition parties said it was no substitute for a UK-US trade deal.
UK government is looking to strike agreements with about 20 states after talks on a broader US-wide trade deal stalled.
International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said the Indiana agreement ""will help deliver value to UK businesses and support our areas of shared interest, such as levelling up"".
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government once saw the prospect of a trade deal with the US as a whole as one of the biggest prizes of leaving the European Union.
But hopes of a quick deal have faded since US President Joe Biden took office and raised concerns about the UK's handling of post-Brexit trade arrangements in Northern Ireland.
Instead, the UK's Department for International Trade is pushing for agreements with individual US states and cities, to help improve trade relations.
greement with Indiana is a memorandum of understanding (MoU), which is a document that sets out the key points of a non-binding economic partnership between two parties.
UK says its agreement with Indiana - a Midwestern state - will remove barriers to trade and pave the way for businesses to invest, export and create jobs.
Opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and pharmaceuticals will be available to businesses under the agreement, the UK says.
It says the agreement would also streamline procurement processes, enable academics to collaborate more easily, and ensure that professional qualifications were recognized on both sides.
In 2019, the UK was the seventh largest export market for Indiana, which has a gross domestic product (GDP) of about $350bn and a large manufacturing sector.
greement was the ""first of many"" the UK would sign ""as we look to bolster our £200bn trading relationship with the US"", Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt said.
Writing for the Conservative Home website, she said agreements with almost half of the 50 US states would follow, including Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas.
Usually trade deals with the US are signed at a national level, between central governments.
But the US government under President Biden has not made a firm commitment to a full free-trade deal with the UK, despite historic ties between the two countries.
Labour's Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Conservatives had promised a comprehensive US-UK free-trade agreement by the end of 2022.
""With less than seven months to go it seems that this will be another broken promise from this government,"" he said.
Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat MP and party spokesperson for trade, said the Indiana agreement ""makes a mockery of the government's promise for Global Britain"".
She said Mr Johnson had ""utterly failed to secure the US trade deal he said he would, being left to negotiate with one state at a time with his tail between his legs"".
SNP international trade spokesperson Drew Hendry said the PM had no chance of striking a US-wide deal while he continued his ""reckless games"" over post-Brexit trade in Northern Ireland.
He added that ""piecemeal"" agreements with individual US states would do ""little to mitigate the huge damage caused by the Tories' chaotic Brexit"".
uation in Northern Ireland, where a dispute over a post-Brexit trade deal has created a block on forming its devolved government, has been a source on tension between the UK and US.
- known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.
UK has proposed legislation that would allow ministers to scrap some of the rules governing trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
But some US lawmakers, who must approve trade agreements, have said they would not support one with the UK if its actions jeopardised the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Last week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ""deeply concerned"" that the UK was seeking to ""unilaterally discard"" the protocol.","business","politics"," politics

rganisations behind the Baftas and Oscars have indicated they are engaged in discussions about the subject.
""It's about everyone being able to feel acknowledged and represented,"" Corrin said.
26-year-old previously won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Emmy for their performance as Princess Diana in series four of The Crown - but that was at a time when Corrin was still accepting she/her pronouns.
re starring in two high profile films this year - My Policeman and Lady Chatterley's Lover.
""It's difficult for me at the moment trying to justify in my head being non-binary and being nominated in female categories,"" Corrin said. 
Reflecting on the fact that they largely play female roles, Corrin wondered: ""When it comes to categories, do we need to make it specific as to whether you're being nominated for a female role or a male role? 
""You can discuss awards and the representation there, but really the conversation needs to be about having more representation in the material itself, in the content that we are seeing for non-binary people, for queer people, for trans people, because then I think that will change a lot. 
""When those parts come up, meaning more people and more actors are playing those roles then I think there will be more of an urgency with which these questions will be addressed.""
A Bafta spokesperson said the organisation was ""engaged in proactive and thoughtful consultation on this subject"". The organisation behind the Oscars, the Academy, is also believed to be conducting research and holding discussions on the issue.
Debate about gender-free categories is gathering steam, with the music industry leading the way. The Grammys went gender-neutral in 2012, while the Brit Awards merged their male and female solo categories into an artist of the year category this year. 
Chart-topper Adele went home with the first trophy. However, in her acceptance speech, she said: ""I understand why the name of this award has changed, but I really love being a woman and being a female artist. I do. I'm really proud of us.""
Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter
more complicated debate than it looks. While gender-neutral categories are seen by some as socially progressive, they could have unintended consequences and there are several factors to consider. 
Firstly, this decision could actually result in less equality in the long term. The Oscars currently guarantee two male and two female acting winners every year, but a merger could mean it skews one way or the other over time.
ke the most recent winners as an example. It is unlikely Jessica Chastain would have beaten Will Smith if they had been competing in one overarching category. 
rtly because this year's best actress race was wide open, whereas Smith was considered a dead-cert in his category. 
But it's also because the best picture category tends to have more overlap with best actor than best actress. Chastain's film wasn't even nominated for the top prize, unlike Smith's. As a result, women could have a higher hill to climb to score a win.
In the long-term, it's not hard to imagine the outrage if a decision like this led to a repeated loss of recognition for worthy winners, particularly women.
's not the only obstacle. The Academy is made up of thousands of members, many of whom have been around for decades and are keen to protect the traditions of the Oscars. Getting some of them on side could be difficult.
feelings of other actors should also be taken into account. If gender-neutral categories were implemented at the Oscars, that would halve the number of acting awards from four to two, permanently reducing an actor's chances of winning an Oscar during their lifetime by 50%. 
While many Hollywood stars consider themselves progressive, they also have rather large egos and will not be enthusiastic about the prospect of forgoing trophies (and the career boost that comes with them).
It's worth noting the existing model does not discriminate against trans actors - Elliot Page and Laverne Cox could both be nominated in the current gendered categories - however it does leave non-binary stars without a home.
But how should this be addressed? Creating a new, separate category for them wouldn't be realistic as there would not be enough nominees. Another proposed solution where actors submit for the gender of the character they are playing would only be a short-term fix, until non-binary characters become more common in films. 
So far, only a few film awards have eliminated gender-specific acting categories, but in August, the Independent Spirit Awards, which honour filmmakers outside the major studios, became one of the most high-profile awards groups to ditch separate best actor and best actress categories and combine them into one prize, with 10 nominations. 
move followed similar steps by the British Independent Film Awards,the Gotham Awards, and the Berlin Film Festival.
Corrin's comments come as they prepare to take to the stage in an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando, which was published in 1928 and explores gender identity.
Orlando begins life as a young man in the 16th Century, who travels through time and gender to become a woman in the 20th Century, having affairs and heartbreaks along the way.  
""On a very personal level, I really relate to the journey of gender and the celebration of fluidity,"" Corrin said.
me something of a pin-up for non-binary identity, sharing their gender journey on social media. Last year they also posted pictures of themselves wearing a chest binder.
Corrin said they decided to share their story publicly because ""it was a journey that was at the very centre of who I am, who I was when I started talking about it"".
""Your gender identity is so much to do with how you feel and it ties into so much of how you want to be seen or are seen by people and that can be very triggering or can make you uncomfortable if you don't feel you are being seen honestly or correctly.
""I think that it was necessary for me to be open and honest about it because otherwise I would have felt I was being perceived wrongly.""
""visibility and representation"" is key to the ""necessary and urgent"" discussions around gender in society at the moment.  
""I know how much I've been helped by people in the public [eye] who have been open and generous with their journeys and how much it's helped me feel comforted and acknowledged and like I am on the right path. 
""And I think that if I could help in any way by being open, then that would be good.""  
worry that being so up front would limit the kind of roles they got offered in the future. 
""I would never sacrifice integrity or honesty because of work that I may or may not get. My being non-binary is not a rejection of femininity or my femininity in any way. It's sort of an embrace of that. 
""I still want to play women, my experience on this earth has been a female one - and now it's sort of a very fluid one.""

MS Victoria is serving as temporary accommodation for families arriving in Scotland from the war-torn country.

Scottish government said it will continue to provide ""safe accommodation for displaced people"" until June 2023.

A second cruise ship used for accommodating displaced Ukrainian refugees is docked in Glasgow.
More than 21,500 people with a Scottish sponsor have arrived in the country since the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, representing 20% of all UK arrivals.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, has criticised the extension.
He said: ""This isn't a new life, it's a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution.
""I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish government as being humiliatingly underprepared.

"/news/world-middle-east-63309101","Watch: Iran rock climber competes without hijab
A large crowd at Tehran airport greeted an Iranian sport climber who competed without a headscarf at a competition in South Korea, calling her a ""heroine"".
Elnaz Rekabi, 33, broke Iran's strict dress code - but later said her hijab had fallen off ""inadvertently"".
Many are sceptical about the reason she gave in an Instagram post and repeated in a state TV interview at the airport, believing it was made under duress.
Iran is gripped by protests against the hijab laws and its clerical leaders.
Iranian women are required to cover their hair with a headscarf and their arms and legs with loose clothing. Female athletes must also abide by the rules when they are officially representing Iran in competitions abroad.
Ms Rekabi flew in before dawn on Wednesday from South Korea, where she had been competing at the IFSC Asian Championships.
Her family met her at the airport, where she was hugged and handed several bunches of flowers. She covered her hair with a black baseball cap and hoodie.
Videos on social media show hundreds of supporters outside the terminal clapping and chanting ""Elnaz is a heroine"" as she arrived.
State media later broadcast an interview with Ms Rekabi, in which she repeated the explanation she had given in an Instagram post for climbing with her hair uncovered.
""I was suddenly and unexpectedly called on to compete while I was at the women's locker room,"" she said. 
""I was busy wearing my shoes and fixing my equipment and forgot to wear my hijab, which I should have worn.""
Ms Rekabi said there had been ""some extreme reactions"" to the video of her appearance sporting a ponytail and that she was ""feeling stressed and tense"".
""Thank goodness, I've returned to Iran in good health and safe. And I apologise to the Iranian people for the confusion and concerns.""
She also denied reports that she had been out of contact with her family and friends and that she had left South Korea earlier than scheduled.
""That didn't happen. We've returned to Iran exactly as planned,"" she stated.
After similar comments were posted on Ms Rekabi's Instagram account on Tuesday afternoon, BBC Persian's Rana Rahimpour said that to many people, the language used looked as though it had been written under duress.
Other Iranian sportswomen who have competed abroad without wearing a headscarf in the past have said they came under pressure from Iranian authorities to issue similar apologies, she added. Some of them decided not to go back to Iran.
British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi told BBC World News: ""When I saw the interview on state TV with Elnaz Rekabi, all I could think of was the hundreds and hundreds of false confessions that we are accustomed to seeing out of Iran. The authorities use forced confessions under duress to disprove any dissident voices.""
Hadi Ghaemi of the US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said Ms Rekabi ""risked her freedom and safety and has since been under extreme pressure by the government to cover up her courageous act of civil disobedience"". 
""It is now the responsibility of all people who support women's and human rights to stand with her and not let the government in Iran cover up the true story,"" he added.
International Olympic Committee said it had been in close contact with the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) and Iran's National Olympic Committee (NOC) since it was informed of the situation with Ms Rekabi.
""A joint meeting took place today between the IOC, the IFSC and the Iranian NOC, during which the IOC and the IFSC received clear assurances that Ms Rekabi will not suffer any consequences and will continue to train and compete,"" a statement said.
""The IOC will continue to monitor the situation closely in the days and weeks to come, in co-ordination with the IFSC and the Iranian NOC.""
Ms Rekabi was hailed as a new symbol of the anti-government protests led by women in Iran after video of her sporting a ponytail at the Asian Championships on Sunday went viral. 
rotests were sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman arrested by morality police in Tehran on 13 September for allegedly wearing her headscarf too loosely. The police denied reports that she was beaten on the head with a baton and said she suffered a heart attack. 
On Monday, a source told BBC Persian that Ms Rekabi's family and friends had lost contact with her after she said she was with an Iranian official. There were also reports that her passport and mobile phone had been confiscated and that she had left her hotel in Seoul two days early.
Iranian embassy strongly denied what it called ""all fake news, lies and false information"" about her and said Ms Rekabi had left Seoul after the Asian Championships ended.","sports","politics"," politics

An inquest heard the Trinity College student had long-term abdominal pain.
His parents said: ""The chronic and increasingly intense physical pain was too much for him to take.""
In a statement, his parents told the inquest at Peterborough Town Hall that their son was ""studious"" and had scored the highest possible grades in school.

Simon Milburn, area coroner for Cambridgeshire & Peterborough, said: ""He found various treatments and medications but despite these it's clear that none of the treatment was able to formally diagnose or alleviate, in the long term, the physical pain he was suffering.""
quest was told Mr Horner, who was from London, was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2019.
He had met with his college tutor on 22 April 2022 where ""no issues"" were identified and he had registered for graduation.
Concerns were raised on 10 May about Mr Horner, who had been missing for four days and had discussed methods of suicide with a friend.

Prof Sachiko Kusukawa, from Trinity College, said Mr Horner was ""remembered as a talented student"" and was a ""valued member of our community"".
Mr Milburn said Mr Horner had ""been unable to cope further with his chronic pain"" and concluded he had died by suicide.
His death was the third of a Trinity College student in three years, two of which have been suicides and one was a death from an overdose of anti-anxiety medication.

Pocket Gods, from St Albans, said the copy of Vegetal Digital, on vinyl, would go on sale at a record store in the Hertfordshire city at 14:00 BST
If sold, they planned to use the money to fund a rival streaming platform that pledges to pay artists more than Spotify and other streaming services.
Spotify has been contacted for comment.
four-piece band said Spotify currently paid it a royalty of £0.002 per stream, but a track had to reach 30 seconds in length to qualify.
Frontman Mark Christopher Lee said musicians routinely get underpaid for their work by the music industry and they have released albums of 30-second songs since 2015 to highlight the lack of what they call fair royalties.
Founded in 1998, the group has been recognised by Guinness World Records as having the most studio albums released digitally, with 75 by 5 November 2021, and previously held the record for most songs on a digital album - with 446.
None of their albums have got in the official UK charts.
's 76th album consists of 10 new full-length songs and will be on sale at Empire Records, which is also the only place fans can hear the album. It will not be available on CD or other formats.
At the same time it goes on sale, the band said they would begin removing their entire catalogue from Spotify.
money will fund Nub Play, a streaming platform, which Pocket Gods said would guarantee to pay artists and songwriters a minimum of 1p per stream.
Lee said he was hoping the album was bought by somebody who was ""obviously rich, someone who loves music and wants to see it have a great future"".
""I'm pretty confident,"" he said. 
""It's time we stopped moaning about Spotify and how unfair the current streaming system is for artists and songwriters and did something positive,"" he said.
""What I want is for artists and songwriters to be valued by their listeners and to be fairly compensated for their life-changing craft.
""I envisage a world where musicians, artists and songwriters will change the world for the better... we must pay them fairly.""

FakeReporter found that by uploading fake running ""segments"" a user could learn the identities and past routes of others active in the area, even if they had the strongest privacy settings.
Information about 100 individuals who exercised at six bases was viewable.
Strava said it had addressed the issue.
Israeli military said it was ""aware of the evolving threats in cyberspace"".
""In order to handle these threats, and in light of previous events such as the one mentioned, the rules and regulations are regularly reiterated and reinforced among those serving in sensitive positions,"" it added.
first time that Strava's tracking features have sparked such security concerns.
In 2018, the company published a global ""heatmap"" that revealed the exercise routes of people at military bases around the world, including US facilities in Syria and Afghanistan.
San Francisco-based Strava is used by more than 95 million people in 195 countries.
Its app takes data, including GPS co-ordinates, from a person's mobile phone or wearable fitness device to track their exercise activity. 
People are able to upload their running and cycling times and compare their performances with others who followed the same routes.
FakeReporter, an Israeli group that combats malicious online activity, reported that a suspicious user named ""Ez Shehl"" had exploited these functions to upload fake GPS data to create route segments inside secret facilities associated with Israel's military, the Mossad intelligence agency and the Shin Bet internal security service.
gments featured straight GPS lines, no times, and unrealistic pacing, such as covering 500m in 0 seconds. 
mings and personal details - including photos, home addresses and the identities of family members - of other users who ran the same segments were subsequently revealed on the Strava scoreboard, even if they had their accounts set to ""private"".
A senior defence official identified as ""N"" was one of at least 100 Israeli individuals affected by the vulnerability, according to FakeReporter. It posted screenshots showing runs from their home and inside various air force bases in Israel, as well as runs in Ukraine. 
FakeReporter said it had told Israeli authorities about the security breach as soon as it became aware and that it had contacted Strava after receiving their approval.
""Despite past revelations, it does not appear that Israeli security agencies have caught up,"" Achiya Schatz, the watchdog's director, said in a statement. ""Although Strava made significant updates to its privacy settings, confused users might still be exposed publicly, even if their profiles were set to 'private'."" 
""By exploiting the capability to upload engineered files, revealing the details of users anywhere in the world, hostile elements have taken one alarming step closer to exploiting a popular app in order to harm the security of citizens and countries alike.""

"/news/uk-politics-63231895","government is working on a plan to help individuals and businesses use energy more efficiently, Prime Minister Liz Truss has said. 
On Sunday, a minister told the BBC a public information campaign to help people cut their energy use was pulled by No 10 on the grounds of cost. 
But the government now appears to have rowed back on that position. 
Energy regulator Ofgem has warned of ""a significant risk"" of gas shortages this winter due to the war in Ukraine. 
government has sought to limit soaring energy costs for households following the invasion by a price cap on energy, which would keep the average bill to around £2,500 a year. 
rgy and cut costs, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) had been preparing plans for a public information campaign.
But the PM was previously reported to have been ""ideologically opposed"" to the campaign, fearing it would be too interventionist. 
On Wednesday, Downing Street said the Beis plans would now be incorporated into an existing scheme. 
During Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Truss was urged by Conservative MP Guy Opperman ""to have a nationwide mailout campaign"" on reduction of energy use. 
In response the PM said Mr Opperman was ""absolutely right"". 
""I know the energy secretary is working on a plan to help companies and individuals use energy more efficiently. We're also working on this across government,"" she said. ""I hope we'll be able to start this going in Number 10 straight away."" 
rime minister's official spokesman said the government was considering how to ""further expand"" the existing ""help for households"" website, which includes advice on cost-of-living support and improving energy efficiency. 
Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Sunday that a public information campaign would have cost up to £15m. 
He said such a campaign was unnecessary because similar work was already been done by National Grid and Ofgem. 
ruption of gas flows from Russia to Europe has led to concerns about energy supplies this winter. 
Although the UK is far less reliant on Russian gas than mainland Europe, it could still suffer knock-on effects from shortfalls in overall supply. 
In a worst-case scenario National Grid, which manages Britain's electricity and gas supply, has warned households could lose power for up to three hours at a time this winter if gas supplies run extremely low. 
Although the company said this was ""unlikely"" it said supply interruptions were a possibility if the energy crisis escalates. ","business","politics"," politics

"/news/uk-politics-63514562","f decarbonising UK public sector buildings is estimated to be £25-30bn, government figures show.
mount was revealed following a Freedom of Information request by the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show.
government said the ""indicative"" figure is based on today's prices and should not be seen as the actual budget needed to move to low carbon heating.
ransitioning from fossil fuel heating systems is one way the UK can meet its aim of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.
government has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from public buildings by 75% by 2037 as part of its net zero strategy.
While new buildings can have low carbon heating systems such as ground-source heat pumps and solar panels fitted from the outset, older properties will need to have the latest equipment retrofitted.
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said the estimated figure for upgrading public sector buildings was based on current ""undiscounted 2022 prices"" and that it was being used within government to inform decisions around transitioning to alternative sources of heating.
It added that the suggested cost could change over time and should not be seen as the actual price of converting public buildings to low carbon. 
use the estimate is based on the cost of installing, converting or retrofitting the whole UK public sector estate - buildings used by the UK government, local authorities, NHS, schools, colleges and emergency services - today.
would also be spread over a number of years.
Decarbonising buildings also includes changing lighting to LED systems and investing in solar panels - which would offset the setup costs through savings on energy supplies.
Dr Sarah Ivory, director of the Centre for Business, Climate Change, and Sustainability at the University of Edinburgh, has looked over the government's estimated figures.
She told the BBC: ""Responding to the impacts of climate change in the UK is going to be an expensive business. 
""It's estimated it will cost the UK economy 3.3% of GDP by 2050.
""Investments now - such as through the conversion of public sector buildings - will pay off in savings in the future. It will also ensure the UK meets our net zero by 2050 emissions targets.""
get an idea of the challenge of decarbonising buildings in the UK, the Climate Change Committee - which advises the UK government and devolved administrations - says there are 28.5 million homes in the UK and 1.9 million other buildings such as offices, shops and hospitals. 
majority are heated by gas boilers, it says, which would need to be replaced to decarbonise homes and buildings.
Nearly a fifth of UK emissions come from buildings, the committee says.
It has estimated the total cost of decarbonising residential properties would require an investment of £250bn - equivalent to £9bn a year from the late 2020s to 2050.
mmittee's David Joffe said the amount of money currently being spent by ministers on low carbon projects was ""insufficient"".
""While the emphasis on public sector leadership is welcome, a larger, firm, multi-year funding settlement is needed beyond 2025 to provide certainty and achieve this decarbonisation target,"" he said.
Public sector bodies can currently access government funds to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings and reduce carbon emissions.
More than £1bn has been spent so far on almost 20,000 projects around the country, according to the company which administers the grants.
Local Government Association wants the government to help local authorities in England speed up investment in low-carbon technologies because it says doing so will save the public sector money, be more resilient to changing energy prices and reduce emissions.
Cllr David Renard, its environment spokesman, told the BBC: ""Investing now in making public buildings more energy efficient would allow councils to ready local businesses and supply chains to make it easier and cheaper for home owners to retrofit their own homes.""
Emma Ashcroft of the Carbon Trust, which advises organisations on net zero, said public bodies should be making decisions on decarbonisation now because of the benefits in energy bills and maintenance cost savings.
""Many public sector buildings will need to replace equipment by 2050, so some of the investment required should be part of business-as-usual spending,"" she told the BBC.
And Julie Hirigoyen, chief executive of the UK Green Building Council, said decarbonising public buildings is a ""no-regrets investment for the government"".
""As energy bills soar, schools, hospitals, and public offices are wasting money on heat leaking from poorly insulated roofs and walls. 
""At a time when public finances are stretched, it is ever more important to invest wisely in those opportunities that can reduce public spending over time,"" Ms Hirigoyen said.
A government spokesperson said: ""We have halved emissions from the central government estate in the last 12 years and invested £2.5bn in supporting those running our public buildings such as schools and hospitals to make similar progress.
""This is on top of our wider efforts to increase our use of home-grown energy such as renewables, increasing our energy security while meeting our net zero ambitions.""

"/news/world-us-canada-62110358","One of Canada's largest mobile and internet providers, Rogers, has apologised for the country-wide outage of its services which began on Friday.
mpany's CEO Tony Staffieri said the failure followed ""a maintenance update in our core network"". 
ransport, banking and emergency services were all hit by Friday's blackout, with 911 hotlines and bank ATMs left unavailable.
Canadians flocked to coffee shops and libraries to find a connection. 
rvice outage began at 04:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Friday and lasted for more than 15 hours, but most services have now been restored. 
Mr Staffieri said the maintenance work ""caused some of our routers to malfunction early Friday morning"". 
utage had a huge effect on a wide range of services across Canada, serving as a reminder of how reliant society has become on modern communications. 
Many 911 services reported difficulties with incoming calls and hospitals asked on-call staff to come into work until the issue was resolved. 
One mother, Lara Morgan, described how she struggled to contact emergency services after her son was injured in a rugby game with a suspected spinal injury. 
Speaking to the Globe and Mail newspaper, she said she eventually found someone with a non-Rogers mobile phone to call 911, only to discover that ambulance services also relied on the Rogers network and were having difficulties dispatching paramedics. Her son eventually made it to hospital and was not badly injured. 
In a statement, Mr Staffieri said the company was ""particularly troubled that some customers could not reach emergency services"". 
utage also caused some events to be cancelled, including the Toronto tour date of Canadian singer The Weeknd. The gig was due to take place at the home of the Toronto Blue Jays, which is owned by Rogers Communications. 
In the province of Quebec, a Montreal court had to delay a trial hearing for disgraced fashion mogul Peter Nygard after jail officials were unable to connect him to a videoconference system. 
Critics say the outage demonstrated a need for more competition in the Canadian telecoms sector. 
ree companies - Rogers, Bell Canada and Telus Corp - control 90% of the market share in Canada.

"/news/uk-wales-63400434","rs to vote on strike: ""It's about safeguarding education""
A teacher said she's prepared to strike, despite feeling guilty about pupils who could lose out on education.
Lowri Lewis Williams, from Denbighshire, said strikes were needed to ""safeguard the future of teaching"".
It comes as teachers in Wales and other parts of the UK are being asked to vote on industrial action after being offered below-inflation pay rises.
It could lead to strikes in the new year after unions rejected a 5% pay offer from the Welsh government.
Union boss Neil Butler said the offer was ""not good enough"" and amounts to a 5% decrease given inflation.
Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the unions' demands were reasonable but a bigger increase was unaffordable.
wo biggest teaching unions start sending ballots to members this week, with others due to follow.
""Teachers have had their pay eroded by inflation for the last 12 years,"" said Mr Butler, of the NASUWT teachers union.
""In fact, teachers' pay has been eroded to the point of 25%, they've lost a quarter of their wage in the last 12 years, enough is enough."" 
In July, the Welsh government accepted the recommendations of the Independent Welsh Pay Review Body, which said teachers should get a 5% pay rise this year with the possibility of a further 3.5% uplift next year.
It would mean starting salaries for new teachers would rise to £28,866, before rising to a minimum of £30,000 next year. 
rs' pay depends on their experience and any extra responsibilities they take on - salaries for more experienced classroom teachers would rise to £44,450.
Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies' Luke Sibieta suggested it amounted to a 3% pay cut after inflation and a 10% reduction since 2010.
""[Morale] is extremely low. And teachers are not just worried about their own positions, they're worried about the future of the education service,"" added Mr Butler.
""We think our ask is extremely reasonable, we want to sit around a table and say if you can't afford 12% what are you going to offer? Because 5% frankly isn't good enough.""
Helen Johns, a teacher and union rep from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said their pay had dropped in value for the past 12 years.
""I feel very strongly that enough is enough,"" she said.
""The system wouldn't run if there wasn't goodwill from teachers - and I think our goodwill has been taken advantage of. 
""Youngsters aren't coming into the profession.
""If we don't stand up now I think we're selling teachers in the future down the river"".
Using another measure of inflation, she said the actual drop in real terms was closer to 20%.
Andrea Jones, a secondary school teacher from Abercrave, Powys, said several teachers she knew left the profession recently for jobs less stress and more pay.
""We have people who are bringing in breakfasts for children, we have people who are bringing in clothes and they simply can't afford it.
""But they are trying to do the best for the people in their care.""
With inflation currently running at 10% NASUWT, which represents Helen and Andrea, said the 5% pay offer would lead to ""more financial misery for hardworking teachers"".
National Education Union, also due to start balloting this week, said members had been ""undervalued for too long"".
School leaders represented by the National Association of Headteachers will also be asked whether they want to take industrial action for the first time in their history.
m was at breaking point because of the big reforms to education such as the new curriculum, combined with problems in recruiting and keeping staff and underfunding of schools.
Most unions are balloting members on the possibility of strike action as well as industrial action short of a strike which could mean sticking to contracted duties only.
riking would be a last resort. The last large scale strike action was in 2008.
Parent Andrew Couvret, from Cardiff, said he hoped the pay dispute was resolved soon.
""My daughter's 13 and with all the time they've had off with Covid I don't think it's the best time to be doing it.""
He said he appreciated the rising cost of living was having an impact ""but I don't think it's in the best interests of the children"".
mportance of teachers should be recognised, according to Amy Owen, also from Cardiff.
""In order for them to do their job properly and feel valued they need to be paid properly.""
ucation minister wrote to unions saying expecting pay to rise with inflation was ""perfectly reasonable"" but impossible without a big increase in the Welsh government budget.
""It is a disgrace the UK government has left us in such an impossible position,"" Mr Miles wrote.
In response, the Treasury said responsibility for funding public services was devolved.
""We have provided the Welsh government with a record £18bn per year for the next three years - the highest spending review settlement since devolution,"" a spokesman said.
Unions insist any pay offer should be fully-funded by government and not come out of individual school budgets.
It is not clear to what extent funding the pay offer will fall directly on schools rather than councils.
Mr Sibieta said ""school finances will be extremely tight"" with extra costs for pay on top of higher energy and food prices.","politics","politics"," politics

"/news/uk-england-london-63703069","Self-proclaimed as London's ""oldest chophouse"", Simpson's Tavern is fighting for its future following a surprise closure.
Grade II-listed tavern has stood on Cornhill for more than 250 years - surviving fires, wars and epidemics.
After getting into rent arrears during the coronavirus pandemic, the venue's locks were changed by the landlord last month, closing the business.
Now the tavern is raising funds to reopen and keep its heritage alive.
Founded in 1757 on Cornhill, Simpson's was where influential people met to trade and do deals over lunch, long before the emergence of the modern skyscrapers of glass and steel that surround it today.
Customers used to be able to look at what meat was on offer, select their preferred cut and watch as it was cooked in front of them on charcoal grills - a service Simpson's provided until 1979.
Now, it sits on the capital's Heritage Walk and is frequently a stop for tourists on guided tours, who are attracted to its rich history and famous former clientele including Charles Dickens. 
After the UK went into lockdown in March 2020, like many hospitality businesses Simpson's built up sizeable rent arrears - of more than £300,000 - and eventually the landlord changed the locks and demanded payment in full.
Benjamin Duggan, the general manager of Simpson's, said: ""Its been extraordinarily difficult for the team. They've done nothing wrong, but now we're sadly going through redundancy conversations with people who've worked with us for decades.
""I've been lucky enough to be the custodian for many years and I can feel the heritage and the significance for people as they come through."" 
He added: ""The time, the blood, the sweat, the tears, the memories, the claret soaked into the walls, the stories absorbed by the furniture - that can't be replicated anywhere else. 
""It lives here in this place, and extinguishing that rubs it from the history sheets in a cruel fashion.""
usiness has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay what is owed, and has raised almost £100,000 so far from nearly 2,500 supporters.
""My only hope is that the landlord and their agents will come to some reasonable sense and understand the damage that they are doing to this historic institution,"" Mr Duggan said.
""But I rely on them coming back, sitting down at the table, discussing a way through and allowing this piece of history to trade and live on.""
Simpson's landlord, Bermuda-based Tavor Holdings, said it did make allowances during the lockdowns but since July 2021 it had been trying to come to an agreement to get the money it is owed.
In a statement, the firm said: ""The issue here is with the tenant, not with Simpson's. The tenant, Restaurant EC3 Limited, is under the control of its sole director and owner Mr Sarvindra Singh. 
""He has consistently failed to settle commitments or engage meaningfully in negotiations over several years. The landlords had no choice but to act.""
Both Simpson's and Mr Singh dispute this.
In the meantime, City of London councillor Peter Dunphy has lodged a request to list the venue as an asset of community value - a designation that aims to protect civic buildings, schools, pubs and open spaces that further the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community.
would give Simpson's a way of ensuring the interior of the business is safeguarded in its current form.
""The impact on this particular business is directly related to the Covid lockdowns because it's a dispute over arrears that built up during that period,"" he said.
A decision on the tavern's application to become an asset of community value is due on 15 December but until then, and without some kind of payment of the money owed, the future of this 265-year-old venue hangs in the balance.

"/news/uk-wales-63315679","When one rock band last played a city nightclub 34 years ago it looked… well, almost identical to how it does today.
Because for some unknown reason, when the doors of Swansea's Cavalier nightclub closed in 1988, it was left entirely untouched to the present day.
Earlier this month workers found half-full drink bottles, menus, DJ equipment and cigarette packets left abandoned.
Members of the Swansea band By Appointment have now returned to visit the ""spooky"" time capsule. 
Bassist Craig ""Lewi"" Lewis and drummer Nigel ""Mugs"" Morgan played the venue many times during the 1980s before the bookings stopped coming. 
""Obviously we found out eventually that it had closed down, but we had plenty of other gigs so we never really looked into the details,"" said Mugs. 
Lewi added: ""I heard something from my agent that the two brothers who owned it might have had licensing issues around exits and fire regulations.
""But that doesn't explain why it was left exactly as it must have been when they closed up on their last night. 
""To me that suggests they must have left in one hell of a hurry - it's all a bit spooky really.""
ghtclub, located above a former British Home Stores shop, was discovered by workmen who were turning the site into a community hub.
Among the undisturbed scene are bottles of Corona lemonade and sweet vermouth Martini Rosso on the bar, both half-full, as well as a jar of cocktail cherries. 
re is also a bar menu offering spaghetti bolognaise, cottage pie or faggots and peas for just £1.50 each.
A poster still hangs publicising which horseracing fixtures are due at Bangor, Hereford, Ludlow and Worcester in 1988, alongside period beer mats and a smashed mirror ball.
écor has a distinct ""Flintstones"" cavernous vibe, adorned with chicken wire and concrete palm trees. 
re derelict Oxford Street shopping unit has been purchased by Swansea council. It will house a new community hub as part of the council's £1bn regeneration programme.
Due to open in early 2024, the hub will be the new home for the central library, West Glamorgan Archives and several other public-facing services.
Swansea council cabinet member Elliott King said: ""It's exciting that our efforts to repurpose a building to play a key role in the city's future have also reminded us of the recent past.
""Nobody knew what to expect when we went in to start our preliminary surveys, but it certainly wasn't this.
""It's possible that shops used the former Cavalier as a storage area, but why the bar was left untouched is a mystery.
""Some of my cabinet colleagues have vague recollections of who owned and managed the bar - but I'd be really interested for the people of Swansea to let us have their memories using #SwanseaCavalier on social media.""
units were hurriedly constructed during the 1950s to replace the shops destroyed when Swansea was bombed by the Nazis in 1941.
While chain stores occupied the ground floor, upper floors were frequently let out to other businesses.
In the early 1970s the predecessor to the Cavalier opened as the Penthouse Club, and was said to be Swansea's only upmarket nightspot of the time.
However, As Mugs explained, when the Penthouse became the Cavalier Club around 1980, it catered for a very different clientele.
""It was rough - even the rats used to wear overalls in there - and the bouncers were brutal,"" he said. 
""The first time we played there in 1984 we had a guitarist  - he could only have been around 15 and his guitar case was almost the same height as him. 
""The doormen threatened to chuck him back down the stairs unless we got him out of there.""
And the punters weren't very well behaved either, Lewi recalled.
""We'd done a pretty good set - Bowie, The Cult, Lou Reed and some of our own stuff - and we were having a beer in the office, laughing at the band after we got pelted with bottles… until we realised our own guitars were still out on the stage.
""We had to dodge the missiles while we crawled back out there to retrieve them… it was like something out of The Blues Brothers.""
For Lewi, in particular, the visit proved highly emotional after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis three years ago. 
""I've been a performer all my life. First in bands and latterly as a magician, but now I no longer have the slight of hand for magic, and I even struggle to bang out a tune on the guitar these days,"" said Lewi.
""But worse than the physical side of MS is the effect it's had on my memory. Before today I was stumped as to what songs we even used to play, but coming back here has made it all flood back.""
Mr King said the council will consider the future of the material discovered.
He said: ""Living memory is hugely relevant to our commitment to future generations.
""Key material will be preserved, documented and made available as part of our responsibility to provide access to local history all for our communities.""  ","entertainment","entertainment"," entertainment

It would also be landscaped, she added.
w area, due to open in May, was paid for with the final donation made by the Crazy Hats Appeal ahead of the charity's closure in June.
It raised about £3.5m over its 20 years.

"/news/uk-england-leeds-64086021","Rugby league star and motor neurone disease fundraiser Rob Burrow's wheelchair accessible van was vandalised while his family were out for a Christmas meal, his father has said.
Geoff Burrow said his son had been out in Castleford, West Yorkshire, on Friday when the vehicle was targeted. 
""They made quite a lot of deep scratches on the back of the van where we wheel Rob in on the ramp,"" he said.
He described the culprits as ""cowards"".
family had been out for an evening meal at the Rockello restaurant in the Glasshoughton area and found the damage at about 21:00 GMT. 
Following a tweet sent by Rob's father, the family said they have been inundated with offers to pay for the repairs and businesses willing to carry out the work for free. 
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Burrow said: ""How anybody can do anything like that, it clearly had a disability sign on it and Rob's disability badges on the front.
""The outpouring of kindness shows you that there's more nice people than scumbags like this person, but we could have done without it - we're going through enough without having to deal with this.""
He said the vehicle was parked near the restaurant and was not obstructing any driveways or on any yellow lines.  
""It spoilt a good night out, they're cowards,"" he said.
""How could someone do it to a disability van, how they sleep is their problem I suppose.""

"/news/business-61411229","f Aviva has responded to ""sexist"" jibes that were allegedly made about her by some of the group's shareholders this week.
Amanda Blanc, group chief executive of UK insurer Aviva, said the comments were ""derogatory"".
She added that she had picked up her ""fair share of misogynistic scars"".  
Financial Times reported a series of remarks that were aimed at senior women, including Ms Blanc, at Aviva's annual general meeting (AGM).
Ms Blanc joined Aviva in July 2020, becoming the company's first female chief executive.
According to the newspaper, two shareholders criticised Ms Blanc at the meeting.
One reportedly said a speech where she highlighted returns to shareholders was at odds with Aviva's share price performance over the last ten years, which signified ""she's not the man for the job"".
Aviva's market capitalisation is about a third higher than when Ms Blanc joined.
Another shareholder is said to have referred back to the company's past bosses and asked whether Ms Blanc should be ""wearing trousers"".
A third reportedly made a jibe about the women on the board, saying: ""They are so good at basic housekeeping activities, I'm sure this will be reflected in the direction of the board in future.""
Writing in a LinkedIn post, Ms Blanc said: ""In all honesty, after 30 plus years in financial services I am pretty used to sexist and derogatory comments like those in the AGM yesterday.""
She added that like ""many other women in business"", she has picked up her ""fair share of misogynistic scars"" during her time working at various companies and in boardrooms.
""I guess that after you have heard the same prejudicial rhetoric for so long though, it makes you a little immune to it all,"" she said.
Ms Blanc said that while she'd like to say things have been improving recently, she feels the opposite is true, with the fact that such comments were now being made publicly rather than in private ""a new development"".
""The more senior the role I have taken, the more overt the unacceptable behaviour,"" she said.
Aviva's chair, George Culmer, criticised the comments at the end of the AGM.
Mr Culmer refused to thank people for their contributions to the session, saying some comments had been ""simply inappropriate"" and adding that he was ""flabbergasted"".
Concluding her post, Ms Blanc expressed her hope that initiatives working towards gender equality will help to eradicate such occurrences in future.
""But in truth that seems a long way off,"" she said. ""So we have little choice other than to redouble our efforts together.""","business","business"," business

"/news/uk-england-leicestershire-63923088","An NHS trust has taken a local council to court over the way it allocated funding from a development.
University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust has taken Harborough District Council to a judicial review at the High Court in London in connection with a site called Lutterworth East.
row relates to a Section 106 agreement developers pay to local authorities to support the developments they build.
written judgement is due shortly.
Developers pay Section 106 agreements and Community Infrastructure Levies (CILs) as part of planning permission they agree with authorities, with the payment intended to support things like new roads, education and health facilities required by the new community.
wo-day hearing heard the trust had asked for Section 106 cash of up to £1m to cover costs for medical services at the Lutterworth East development.
- which includes 2,750 homes, two schools and warehousing - is being developed by Leicestershire County Council.
rust asked the council to reflect this in the agreement it struck with the developers.
Harborough District Council said it had considered the request but was not able to accommodate it as funding regulations stood.
During the hearing, problems arose in establishing exactly what contracts the local NHS were already committed to and how funding was being projected.
judge, Mr Justice Holgate, said: ""There is an allowance for population growth, but no-one knows exactly what it is - after all this hot air.""
After the two-day hearing, he said he would reserve his judgement.
rties involved expect a written statement from him in the coming days.

"/news/technology-62788725","Revolutions in art are nothing new, but this one, some think, may be terminal.
""Art is dead Dude"", Jason M Allen told the New York Times.
Mr Allen is the winner of the Colorado State Art Fair's competition in the category of ""emerging digital artists"".
His winning entry ""Théâtre D'opéra Spatial"" was made using Midjourney, an artificial intelligence system that enables images to be created simply by inputting a few text prompts - for example ""an astronaut riding a horse"".
Many artists were furious, but Mr Allen was unmoved: ""It's over. A.I. won. Humans lost"", he told the paper.
Mr Allen earned just $300 (£262) from the contest, but the news struck a tender nerve. 
Some artists were already fearful that a new breed of AI image generator could take their jobs, and take a free ride on the years spent learning their craft.
""This thing wants our jobs, it's actively anti-artist"", wrote California-based movie and game concept artist RJ Palmer in a Tweet liked more than 25,000 times.
In Twitter posts he highlighted how well the output of AI systems could imitate living artists. In one case he examined, the AI even attempted to reproduce artists' signatures. 
utput of these AI systems is impressive, but they are built upon the output of flesh-and-blood creators - their AIs are trained on millions of human-made images.
Stable Diffusion, a recently launched open-source AI image generator, learns from a compressed file of ""100,000 gigabytes of images"" scraped from the internet, its founder Emad Mostaque tells me.
Mr Mostaque, a computer scientist with a background in tech and finance, sees the Stable Diffusion as a ""generative search engine"".
Whereas Google image searches show you pictures that already exist, Stable Diffusion shows you anything you can imagine.
""This is a  Star Trek Holodeck moment"" he says.
Artists have always learned from and been influenced by others - ""great artists steal"" as the saying goes - but Mr Palmer says of AI is not just like finding inspiration in the work of other artists: ""This is directly stealing their essence in a way"".
And AI can reproduce a style in seconds: ""Right now, if an artist wants to copy my style, they might spend a week trying to replicate it,"" Mr Palmer tells me.
""That's one person spending a week to create one thing. With this machine, you can produce hundreds of them a week"".
But Mr Mostaque says he's not worried about putting artists out of work - the project is a tool like Microsoft's spreadsheet software Excel, which - he notes - ""didn't put the accountants out of work, I still pay my accountants"".
So what is his message to young artists worried about their future career, perhaps in illustration or design? ""My message to them would be, 'illustration design jobs are very tedious'. It's not about being artistic, you are a tool"".
He suggests they find opportunities using the new technology: ""This is a sector that's going to grow massively. Make money from this sector if you want to make money, it'll be far more fun"".
And there are already artists using AI art for inspiration and to make money.
OpenAI say their DALL-E AI system is used by more than 3,000 artists from more than 118 countries.
re have even been graphic novels made using AI. The author of one called the tech ""a collaborator that can excite and surprise you in the creative process"".
But although there is a lot of anger about the way AIs use artists' work, experts say legal challenges may be difficult. 
Professor Lionel Bently, director of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Law at Cambridge University, says that in the UK ""it's not an infringement of copyright, in general, to use the style of somebody else"".
Professor Bently tells me an artist would need to show that output of an AI had reproduced a significant part of their original creative expression in a particular piece of their art used to train the AI.
Even where that's possible - not many artists will have the means to fight such legal battles.
Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS), which collects payments on behalf of artists for the use of their images, is worried.
I asked DACS' head of policy Reema Selhi if artists' livelihoods are at stake. ""Absolutely yes,"" she says.
DACS is not against the use of AI in art, but Ms Selhi wants artists, whose work is used by AI image systems to make money, to be rewarded fairly and have control over how their works are used.
""There are no safeguards for artists [..] to be able to identify works in databases that are being used and opt out"" she adds.
Artists might be able to claim copyright infringement when an image is scraped from the internet in order to be used to train an AI - although legal experts I spoke to suggested a number of reasons why such a claim might fail.
And Ms Selhi said proposed changes to UK law would instead make it easier for AI companies to legally scrape artists' work from the internet -  something which DACS opposes.
Mr Mostaque says he understood artists' fears and frustrations, noting that ""you saw this with photography as well"".
He said the project was working with ""technology industry leaders to create mechanisms by which artists can upload their portfolios and request for their styles not to be used in online services using this and similar technology"".
Google previously created an AI that could create images from text prompts. Called Imagen, it was never opened up for the public to experiment with because of the ""potential risks of misuse"".
Google warned that the datasets of scraped images used to train AI's often included pornography, reflected social stereotypes, and contained ""derogatory, or otherwise harmful, associations to marginalized identity groups"".
Recently Techcrunch reported on concerns that Stable Diffusion could be used to create non-consensual pornography, so-called deepfakes and other problematic images.
Mr Mostaque says that kind of unethical use ""breaks the license terms"". And he says the software already filters out attempts to create not-safe-for-work imagery, although that can be worked around by the technically savvy.
But  the onus, he says, is ""upon the person doing something illegal"", and other existing tools can also be abused, for example someone could use ""Photoshop's merge tool to stick someone's head on a nude"".
Sci-fi artist Simon Stålenhag tweeted that AI art revealed, the ""kind of derivative, generated goo .. our new tech lords are hoping to feed us"".
And there are some big names connected to the development of the tech. The ""techno-king"" himself Elon Musk is a backer of OpenAI.
Far from being ""derivative goo"", they say DALL-E assists human creativity and produces ""unique, original images that have never existed before"".
For a final opinion, I rang up contemporary artist and broadcaster Bob-and-Roberta-Smith (the name belongs to just one artist). 
He's had work in the big galleries, and will be staging an artistic takeover of the shop in London's Tate Modern gallery in October.
He works in old-school physical media mainly but he thinks AI could be an interesting area of artistic activity, in the tradition of the mash-up. 
But policy makers, he says, need to get the rules right, ""so nobody feels ripped off"", and money isn't just siphoned off from artists and into the pockets of big corporations.

"/news/newsbeat-63977299","If you're desperate to get to the front row for your favourite singer, then you might consider queueing early for a concert.
Some even take the step of waiting in line overnight, sometimes days. 
But for those who camped to see Louis Tomlinson's show on Tuesday, they had an unexpected surprise. 
Banquet Records - who often run gigs at Pryzm in Kingston, London - told them before the show that people who stayed overnight would not be let in first.
Staff had previously made clear on social media that queueing overnight, due to the extremely cold temperatures, wasn't allowed.
It also said on tickets that queues before 08:00 wouldn't be recognised.
Posting on Twitter, Banquet Records said they were aware the new system ""will upset some but there has to be repercussions for queuing too early"".
Jon Tolley, who runs the record shop, said he was ""nervous"" about making the call.
But he wants the decision to discourage camping at other gigs too, such as future shows with Yungblud and Machine Gun Kelly. 
He says that some fans had been camping since Wednesday last week, for the first show on Monday.
""It's unsafe for people to be on the streets - we spoke to Louis' management as soon as we saw that was happening,"" he tells BBC Newsbeat.
""If people see that other people are queuing, they have a fear of missing out. And they want to queue too. 
""You could have 200-300 people sleeping on the streets, in minus four degrees in the snow,"" he adds.
""We spoke to the council, and we said that if it reached a certain number of people, we would just pull the gig.""
Jon understands some fans were devastated, but, ultimately, he says Banquet ""had to do something to look after music fans"". 
""I think people can understand why we did what we did - the feedback generally has been very good.""
One person who was in the queue since midday on the day of the show is Mia Segal.
20-year-old says she often makes friends in queues for gigs. 
And while she's ""all for people doing what they want"" she understands why the venue made the call.
""Some of these people were queuing since Thursday night in the snow, which is extremely dangerous. By doing this, they ran the threat of the shows possibly being cancelled which is selfish for everyone else going,"" she says. 
She feels ""queuing culture has become worse"" since Covid impacted live music venues.
""People think they're entitled to queue even if the venue can't facilitate them, it just puts so many things at risk and isn't worth it,"" Mia adds.
On social media, the move by Banquet Records has been met with a largely positive reaction.
Music fan Kieran Raza, 27, says he hopes the ""practice is put into place in other venues around the country"".
""Because it's a much bigger issue in arenas and stadiums when people are queuing for days to see Harry Styles in a pit at the front of the stage. If you're one row from the front, it really doesn't detract from your experience,"" he says.
""But it's venues that are responsible for putting that into place, in order to uphold the safety and integrity of the event.""
But Jo Cosgrove can understand why gig goers can sometimes go to big lengths to see their favourite acts. 
23-year-old camped for a Twenty One Pilots show in 2019, and says ""in the future Pryzm should not be doing this"". 
""No venue should be doing this because you're punishing fans for being passionate at the end of the day.
""And fans will always be passionate - you will never stop that you will only push people away from your venue.""

"/news/uk-northern-ireland-63954968","GPs in Northern Ireland are an endangered species, a senior doctor has said. 
Dr Frances O'Hagan, a partner GP at the Friary Surgery in County Armagh, said most surgeries did not have enough GPs or reception staff to meet demand.
umber of GP practices in Northern Ireland has fallen by about 9% and nine surgeries have recently handed back their contracts.
However the number of individual GPs has increased.
Dr O'Hagan said GP practices were on their knees.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Dr O'Hagan said low staffing was the main reason people would struggle to get an appointment.
""All we want to do is give good care to our patients, but the problem is we have no GPs and no reception staff,"" she said.
""GPs are an endangered species. There are not enough of us, they are not training enough of us and they're not facilitating keeping more of us in practice.""
Dr O'Hagan said she worked more than 50 hours a week, despite officially only working for three days part-time.
remaining two days are spent on administration and following up with patient's conditions. 
She said a GP's workload would make it impossible to see patients face-to-face on a full-time basis. 
""We have to be very careful,"" she said.
""If we don't make general practice an attractive place to work, if we don't bring young GPs in and we don't stop GPs like myself retiring, we're going to have nobody left.""
Friary GP Surgery has 9,000 patients on its books who live within a six mile radius and is one of three GP surgeries on the same site. 
Patients can call to arrange an appointment on weekdays between 08:30 and 09:00 GMT.
Reception staff Mary McIlroy and Rosie Prunty told the BBC the surgery usually received up to 130 calls during this period.
""You can feel your stomach churning a wee bit just before the phones start,"" Ms McIlroy said. 
""It's stressful. You feel under pressure because the phones ring all the time and you're trying to get people sorted as best you can.""
Ms Prunty said patients could become frustrated when appointments filled up.
""Most of the time they're good, but there's the occasional time that people don't react well whenever they're told the appointments are all gone for the day,"" she said. 
At the end of March 2022 there were 319 GP surgeries in Northern Ireland, down from 350 in 2014. 
umber of registered patients per practice rose by about 15% - from 5,500 to 6,340 - in the same period.
Despite the decrease in practices, the number of GPs, excluding locums, went up by 20% to 1,419 since 2014.
rman of the British Medical Association's Northern Ireland GP committee Dr Alan Stout said GPs' workload had increased dramatically over recent years. 
""We're trying to deliver a better service for our patients and we are more frustrated than anybody else whenever we can't deliver that. 
""The problem that we have at the moment is no matter what way you do it, whether its an appointment system, whether its phone-first, we just don't have the capacity to meet the demand - the demand is just phenomenal.""
Dr Stout said he believed GPs could deliver a much better level of primary care but practices needed to be realistic over the service they could provide.
""We need the whole system to change and to pivot to out-hospital care, keeping people at home and having the staff and the resource within primary and community care to achieve that,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Department of Health has confirmed a potential new contractor has been found to take over a County Antrim GP practice that was earmarked for closure.
Ballymena Family Practice was due to close in January after its doctor handed back their contract.
A total of 3,204 patients were to be moved to other surgeries, but the Department of Health said it is finalising arrangements for a takeover and it hoped this process will be completed by 31 January.
""The existing contract holder has agreed to maintain the contract for the month of January until this process is completed,"" it added.
A second GP practice in Ballymena, which has 3,840 registered patients, is due to hand back its contract on 31 May.
Department of Health said the contract would be advertised imminently, and applications sought from interested parties.
It said ""both practices are continuing to offer services as normal"".","health","health"," health

"/sport/olympics/58084934","After making history by becoming Great Britain's youngest Olympic medal winner of all time, skateboarder Sky Brown is already plotting her next move - in surfing.
13-year-old claimed bronze in the inaugural women's park final in Tokyo, and immediately raised the prospect of competing in two sports at Paris 2024.
Brown told BBC Sport: That's the goal, that's my dream, competing for skating and surfing in Paris. That would be really cool. I surf more than I skate!""
Her father, Stu, revealed he dissuaded his daughter from trying to compete in surfing as well as skateboarding in Tokyo, but admits he may be powerless to stop her again.
""It'll be up to her by then. She'll be 16, and it's hard enough now,"" he joked.
Sky goes surfing most days before school and has competed at junior levels, finishing second in an aerial surfing invitational in Texas.
re could be one issue making it challenging for Sky to realise her ambition - the surfing is due to be held in Tahiti, nearly 10,000 miles from the French capital where the skateboarding will take place.
Having never had a skateboarding coach, Sky learns most of her tricks from watching YouTube videos, and her natural sporting talent appears to transfer to the water.
Sky, who splits her time between the United States and Japan, often takes advantage of the Californian climate and surfs with her dad, and brother Ocean.
When asked whether it was possible to compete in both events in 2024, she said: ""Maybe. I really hope so - I'm definitely going to try [to compete in] surfing.
""I'm going to go surf a lot after here. I'm excited to see my brother again.""
But that's for 2024. For now, Sky says she is living a ""dream"" after skateboarding success at Tokyo 2020. It's been quite the journey.
Warning: external video from Sky's Instagram account contains footage some viewers may find distressing.
If the Games were held in 2020, it's highly unlikely Sky would have been fit to compete in Tokyo.
Stu said his daughter was ""lucky to be alive"" after crashing last May between two ramps while attempting a jump in training, fracturing her skull, breaking her left arm and wrist, and suffering lacerations to her heart and lungs.
Her parents wanted her to stop skating but she said: ""This will not stop me. I am going for gold in Tokyo 2021.""
In June a video was posted on her Instagram showing the moment she lost control at the top of a ramp. It cut away before the fall to a shot of an air ambulance, followed by a message to her followers from her hospital bed, black eye, arm in a cast.
Nothing is normal for this incredibly talented 13-year-old but perhaps this video, which has more than two million views, underlines just how different her life is.
Sky also tumbled before her Olympic qualifier, breaking her arm, but still came first while wearing a protective cast.
She breezed into Wednesday's final in Tokyo, making light work of her heat with the second-highest score.
It was a nervy start as she fell in her first two runs, putting her fourth going into her last effort - which she admitted she wasn't expecting.
""I thought I was gonna get it. I was a little shocked after the first run. Then after the second fall, I was like, 'Am I gonna make it?'
""Sakura [Yosozumi, Japan's gold medal winner] told me: 'You got it, Sky. We know you're gonna make it'. That really made me feel better.""
Words of encouragement from her dad also helped.
""He was like: 'You know, it's just a contest. It doesn't define you.' That made me feel better - it is just a contest and if you fall, that's what it is,"" added Sky.
ger, who celebrated her 13th birthday just 16 days before the opening ceremony in Tokyo, showed incredible composure to get a clean final run and complete the kickflip indy - the trick that wiped her out in her first two attempts - to seal the bronze with a score of 56.47.
Sky, who was born a month before the Beijing Olympics in 2008, speaks incredibly maturely for a teenager. After finishing on the podium said she hoped more young girls would follow in her footsteps.
""I really hope I inspire young girls. I feel like people aren't too young that they can't do it, but if you believe in yourself you can do anything. I believed in myself,"" she said.

"/news/uk-england-essex-63870210","median and actor Russell Brand has lent his support to save the local theatre he once performed at as a child.
Brand told an audience at the Thameside Theatre in Grays, Essex, that Thurrock Council had ""lost its path"". 
urrock Council is looking at the building's future as it deals with a £469m budget back hole. 
Conservative-run council said: ""No decision on the future of the Thameside Complex has yet been made.""
During a day-long event on Monday at the Thameside complex, owned by the council and home to a theatre, museum and library, Brand said saving the theatre would be ""an opportunity to change the perception of Thurrock Council at a vital time"".
uncil's debt is largely due to it borrowing hundreds of millions to invest in companies financing solar energy.  
It has asked the government for help and spending cuts are expected as well as selling off its assets.
""Thurrock Council is currently assessing business cases from bidders which have expressed an interest in the property,"" a spokesman said.
Brand said: ""The spirit of this event, good humour aside, is not about the recrimination or condemnation or engaging the typical political arguments that create a kind of ossified oppositionism, this is about creating a situation where passionate members of the community can continue to use this asset to benefit the very community that it was created to serve.""
It had ""lost its path investing in ideas that have not yielded fruit"", he said.
mic, who was born in Grays, told the audience: ""We simply want one thing: the Thameside Theatre be handed over to the Save Thameside Campaign.""
Neil Woodbridge, who was bidding to run the venue as a community enterprise, said due to the debt there was a ""question mark"" over whether they would be successful.
Brand said: ""There are some values that transcend financial and economic ones.
""Look at what the pursuit of financial goals has done to Thurrock Council, all these moody deals with solar panels and we ain't see the light of day yet!""
mic phoned senior councillors and Thurrock Council officers live on stage. 
Conservative councillor Shane Ralph went on stage after he was called. 
""I want this theatre to stay here,"" he said. ""I didn't want this to be brought down or anything. 
""The chance it could be saved by anybody for me is a positive. 
""I would love it to be a community asset. But what I want to know is in 10 years' time, is it still going to be viable?""
Labour leader on the council, John Kent, said an alternative bid to turn Thameside into a college was ""a red herring"".
Andrea Ince, involved in promoting the pantomime, said: ""It's very sad because it's important for the community. 
""There's lots of artists around here that started their life as performers on that Thameside theatre stage, it's important it's here to give that chance to other people.""

"/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-63767570","A five-year-old boy who died after being sent home from a hospital could have been saved if he had been treated earlier, his family has claimed.
Yusuf Mahmud Nazir's uncle said he had ""begged"" staff at Rotherham Hospital to treat his nephew's severe throat infection with intravenous antibiotics.
He said he was told the children's ward had ""not got the doctors"" and ""not got the beds"". Yusuf died on 23 November.
rust has begun an investigation into what happened.
Zaheer Ahmed said Yusuf fell ill with a sore throat on 13 November. The following day he went to his GP and was prescribed antibiotics.
When the boy's condition worsened he was taken to Rotherham Hospital in South Yorkshire. 
After waiting for hours Yusuf was seen by a doctor who, according to Mr Ahmed, told him the child had ""the worst case of tonsillitis he had ever seen"".
Despite the diagnosis he was not admitted to hospital. 
When Yusuf's condition deteriorated further, Mr Ahmed said he called the children's ward at the hospital. 
""We were begging them for their help,"" he said.
""I said 'Please can you help me I've got nobody else to go to. He needs IV antibiotics, he's struggling breathing'.
""They didn't want to know. They just said 'We've not got the doctors, we've not got the beds. I can't just pull a bed out of the air'. 
""'We've got queues of kids waiting, it's not just your child' and I said 'Yeah, but he needs this treatment'. 
""'So do other children' - that's exactly the response I got.""
Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust later said its hospital did not provide paediatric intensive care beds. 
Yusuf Mahmud Nazir's uncle: 'We were begging for their help""
On Friday 18 November, Yusuf was unable to speak, eat or drink so was taken by ambulance to Sheffield Children's Hospital.
After being given intravenous antibiotics, Mr Ahmed said his nephew seemed to improve and started drinking and eating again. However, his condition deteriorated and he died on Wednesday 23 November.
""The infection - what should have been treated in Rotherham - just spread to his chest, spread to to his lungs... organ failures and just taken his life from there,"" said the boy's uncle.
""If he had got IV antibiotics, he would have been here. He would have be playing with us now, if he got that when I begged them.""
Mr Ahmed said the family wanted answers from the hospital and the government to prevent future deaths.
""I don't know if it would have been a different situation if they did have the beds or weren't overwhelmed,"" he said. 
Dr Richard Jenkins, chief executive of The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust, offered his ""sincere condolences to Yusuf's family"".
""We have commenced a thorough investigation into Yusuf's care, which will include liaison with Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust,"" he said. 
""I want to assure families that we have an appropriately staffed medical paediatric service who provide support to our medical colleagues working within our Urgent Emergency Care Centre when required. 
""We, like other district general hospitals in the South Yorkshire region, do not provide paediatric intensive care beds. 
""The Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust is a specialist trust who do provide paediatric intensive care beds.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""All children deserve the highest levels of care and we are taking urgent action to ensure no families have to experience these kinds of tragedies.
""Last week we announced up to £8bn for health and social care in 2024-25 and we're giving an extra £500m to speed up hospital discharge and free up beds, ensuring people are only in hospital for as long as they need to be.""

"/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-63582957","Isle of Man's health minister has been sacked after seven weeks in the post.
Chief Minister Alfred Cannan said he asked Rob Callister MHK to step down after deciding the health department needed a ""different approach"".
Mr Callister said the island's politics ""can be extremely difficult and unfair at times"" and he had not been given a ""fair opportunity"" to make changes.
""To say this announcement has broken me is an understatement,"" he added.
Lawrie Hooper MHK will now return to head the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) while remaining Enterprise Minister.
Mr Hooper had been moved to his enterprise role in a mini-reshuffle overseen by Mr Cannan in September, which also saw Mr Callister take up his health role.
Mr Cannan said the change was needed because the DHSC was at a ""critical juncture"".
Reacting to the news online, Mr Callister said Manx politics ""can be extremely difficult and unfair at times"" and he would make ""a more formal statement in due course"".
f minister said the island's health and care sector was facing a ""complex set of challenges"" and, after recent talks, he had ""reluctantly concluded"" the DHSC needed new leadership.
He thanked Mr Callister for his ""positive work"" and said he expected the Onchan MHK to be ""back contributing in the near future"".
It is the third time a minister has left the Council of Ministers during Mr Cannan's administration, which began in October 2021.
David Ashford resigned as treasury minister in May in the wake of an employment tribunal which found the island's top medic was unfairly dismissed while he was in his previous position as health minister during the pandemic.
was followed by the resignation of Tim Crookall as enterprise minister in July after he decided he could no longer ""play an effective part in the Council of Ministers team"".

"/sport/africa/64043612","Kenyan marathoners Diana Kipyokei and Purity Rionoripo have been banned from athletics for doping, meaning there are now at least 60 athletes from the country currently serving suspensions issued by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). 
Kipyokei, whose 2021 Boston Marathon title has now been annulled, and Rionoripo, winner of the Paris Marathon in 2017, have been banned for six and five years respectively. 
for Kipyokei, 28, has been backdated to June 2022, when the AIU provisionally suspended her, while her results have been disqualified since the day she provided a urine test following her Boston win in October 2021. 
""That sample returned an adverse analytical finding (AAF) for the presence of a metabolite of triamcinolone acetonide, an anti-inflammatory,"" the AIU said in a statement. 
""With investigative assistance from the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya, the AIU discovered that Kipyokei provided false/misleading information in trying to explain her AAF, including fake documentation which she alleged came from a hospital."" 
Rionoripo's ban came after the presence of the diuretic furosemide in an out-of-competition test in Kenya conducted in May. 
Like Kipyokei, the 29-year-old was also found to have attempted to have tampered with the evidence against her. 
""In her explanation, she claimed to have been prescribed medication by a doctor at a hospital to treat an ankle injury and presented supporting documentation,"" the AIU continued. 
""Investigations revealed that though Rionoripo was treated at the hospital, she had altered her prescription form."" 
Since she has admitted her guilt, the six-year ban sought by the AIU for Rionoripo was reduced by twelve months, and has been backdated to start from 21 November. 
Elsewhere, another Kenyan - Betty Wilson Lempus - has been charged with a further violation, on top of the provisional suspension announced in October after also being accused of tampering. 
Like both Kipyokei, she was found to have triamcinolone acetonide in her system, which the AIU confirmed after dismissing the explanation given for her positive test. 
In response to the attempts to explain away failed drug tests through concocted stories, the head of the AIU has pledged to keep tackling these practices. 
""[We will use] the full extent of our intelligence and investigative capabilities to uncover the truth and keep the sport of athletics clean,"" said Brett Clothier. 
Clothier also addressed the recent pledge by the Kenyan government to commit $5m annually, which is believed to have helped avert a sanction by governing body World Athletics. 
""It is a crucial first step and has the potential to be a game changer because it will ensure [the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya] and Athletics Kenya have proportionate resources to play their part in the fight against doping."" ","sports","sports"," sports

"/sport/63066765","At a glitzy downtown New York hotel, the recently founded Black Athletes Hall of Fame was holding its annual ceremony. 
It was March 1976 and the host was giving a speech about the latest inductee. You probably won't know her name. 
Ora Washington was a champion, a star of two sports, but prejudice stopped her competing for the biggest prizes of the day. Her sporting career spanned three decades of change in her native United States, but change didn't come quickly enough. 
Washington retired from tennis and basketball in the 1940s. In the mid-1970s a new generation started to dig deeper into her story. Hence the gathering in New York. 
As the host finished introducing Washington to those gathered for that glamorous occasion, they started on something new: an apology. 
Washington wasn't there. There was a chair placed out on the stage for her, empty. The host said they were sorry but they hadn't been able to track her down.
New York Times wrote in its report the next day: ""The silver bowl, gold ring and medallion she was to receive have been returned to the Hall of Fame offices in New York. And Miss Washington's whereabouts remain a mystery.""
What nobody seemed to know was that Washington had already been dead for five years.  
BBC Sounds and the BBC World Service have made a podcast series about Washington's life. You can listen to episodes here.
Part of the motivation behind doing so was to get her story out there where it belongs, so it's not forgotten. 
Washington's is a powerful and important story. She was one of the most extraordinary Black female athletes of the 20th century. Tennis great Arthur Ashe described her as ""the first Black female to dominate a sport"". 
re are still lots of things we can't know about Washington, but we do know she received homophobic abuse, and that racism and white supremacy denied her both the opportunity and recognition she deserved. 
Washington's life threw up obstacles all along the way. And she took on the same types of injustice that many are still fighting today. 
Washington was born in January 1898 or 1899 - the records aren't clear. Her early life was spent in a small farming community called File in Caroline County, Virginia. 
Hers was a large, tight-knit family, and they owned a farm. They'd built up some economic independence by the standards of the day. Historian Pamela Grundy, who contributes to the podcast series, went there some years ago and found out Washington was the fifth of nine children. 
Grundy tracked down JB Childs, Washington's nephew, who shared his memories of the farm.
""They grew tobacco, corn wheat, rye and all sorts of vegetables,"" he told her. ""Tobacco was the biggest money strike. They raised tobacco and sold it in the winter - always have some for Christmas, whoever needed it. That's the way they made a living.""
My own family has its roots not too far away. My mom's grandma was born just a couple of years after Washington, in the neighbouring state of West Virginia. She was also raised in a farming area, and also under the Jim Crow laws. 
As residents of Virginia, the Washingtons lived under a web of legislation ensuring they would remain second-class citizens at every stage of their lives - formal segregation by race. 
Some examples: in 1900, when Washington first appeared in the United States census, Virginia passed a law forcing railroad companies to provide separate cars for Black and white riders. Another law did the same for steamboat passengers. Schools were segregated too - but not equal.   
Stories get passed down through families about those times in the South. It goes deeper than the law. We're talking about a whole culture of fear, touching every part of normal life. Fear of violence, fear of persecution. 
In 1910 the census man paid another visit to the farm, 10 years on from the last. This time, Washington is listed as 12 years old. Her mother is not listed. Her father is now a widower. 
When I picture that little girl growing up, living with dad and grandma and her brothers and sisters, with money short, I know they had to be hard times.
And that's why I think what happens next makes a lot of sense. 
At this time in the US there is a mass movement taking place. A movement that changed a nation.
Across the first quarter of the 20th century, Black American people were leaving the South and heading for the cities and jobs of the North: New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and many others. What historians call 'The Great Migration'.
We can't be sure when, but sometime in the 1910s a teenage Washington packed her bags and left the old family farm, and the South, for good. 
She took the train north to Philadelphia to join her Aunt Mattie, stepping into the big city for the first time, into a new life. The world she was entering was rich with newly emerging opportunities that previous generations of women - particularly Black women - never had, including organised sport.
When Washington next appears on the US census in 1920, she is listed as the younger of two servants working in a wealthy white home in the Philadelphia suburbs. 
Her introduction to tennis may have come around the same time, in the north Philadelphia district of Germantown, a place where new arrivals to the city - Italian, Irish, Black American - made their homes. She took lessons in the game at a branch of the Germantown Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) set up to ""make possible"" for girls and women of colour the ""advantages of so long enjoyed by the white girls and women of our community"".
Further detail of this time is thin on the ground. We don't have any surviving letters, and the few who interviewed her during her sporting career didn't publish anything about her personal life. 
However, there are surviving reports from Black newspapers like the Philadelphia Tribune - the oldest in the US (it was founded in 1884) and still publishing now. 
One article implies Washington first began competing in national Black women's competitions in 1923, possibly just a few years at most after first picking up a racquet. Another account describes her unique way of holding the racquet - almost halfway up the handle - and another the power of her volleys. 
Whenever she started, it's clear she was a natural. She would very soon take the sport by storm.
In 1925, Washington scored a huge victory by beating Isadora Channels, twice a winner of national championships organised by the American Tennis Association (ATA), a Black national tennis organisation founded in 1916.
It marked the start of her evolution as a player. She would move from being seen as a successful athlete to a once-in-a-generation talent. 
Also in 1925, the same year as her victory over Channels, Washington won her first tennis ATA doubles title. She went on to win that title every year up to 1936. In the singles game she would win the women's ATA trophy from 1929 to 1935. Seven years as champion at the top. 
Washington was a headliner who dominated Black sports media coverage, but this was still pre-war America. In contrast to another serial champion of this time - the white player Helen Wills, who won her seventh national title in 1931 - Washington's success was allowed to exist only in isolation. Not until 1950 would an African-American participate in the US Championships Wills was dominating - we know that tournament today as the US Open. 
re would be no mainstream superstardom, no merchandising or endorsement deals from international sportswear brands. The competitions she won didn't lead to global fame or untold riches. 
xt US census shows it. In 1930, Washington was working in Chicago as a hotel maid. 
Around the time of Washington's big tennis breakthrough in 1925, her name was also beginning to appear on lists of Black women's basketball teams as well.
By the end of the 1920s she was competing almost as much in basketball as in tennis, right at a time when she was picking up multiple tennis trophies across the country and building a reputation as the best Black female player in the US. 
One of the first basketball teams Washington played for was the Germantown YWCA Hornets - a so-called 'Black Fives team' or 'Black Quint' - 'Black' because these teams were only for Black players.  
She became a star as the team steadily rose. Reports of the day speak of outrageous long shots, of record scores that carried her side to victory. On 9 April 1931, the Hornets claimed the National Girls Basketball Title, beating Rankin Femmes, a team from near Pittsburgh, in the final. 
Mirroring her achievements in tennis, Washington had become the kind of basketball player people look forward to watching on the court. 
Philadelphia Tribune saw an opportunity and decided to sponsor a team. The Philadelphia Tribunes were coached by a prominent local activist called Joe Rainey - whose grandfather, also Joseph Rainey, was the first Black person to serve in the United States House of Representatives.
ribunes stood for more than sporting excellence, more than just advertising a local newspaper - or even about collecting trophies.
""Sport was seen as a really important place to argue for civil rights, in particular because sports was a performance of meritocracy, at least, in theory,"" says Dr Amira Rose Davis, assistant professor of history and African American studies at Penn State University.
""It was a place that many Black civic and political leaders saw as an opportunity to expand and demonstrate how Black folks were fit for citizenship.""
In 1932, Washington was recruited as captain of the Tribunes. The Tribune newspaper celebrated her exploits, holding her up as the star of a team that won 11 consecutive championships.
But despite this, at a time when sporting celebrities had already begun to emerge, there was never any coverage of her private life. Such focus did fall on other female athletes of the day - but only in a particular way. Washington did not fit that template.
""There was this policing of their sexuality, of their femininity,"" says Dr Rose Davis.
""Think of Black baseball player Toni Stone. They did a spread in a Black magazine about her and featured her in a dress because they wanted to show that she still was domestic. 
""They had a picture of her without her shirt on, laying down, getting rubbed down by her husband so they could demonstrate she was still heterosexual."" 
Whether Washington privately saw herself as more masculine or feminine, or as heterosexual or homosexual or anything else, is impossible to know from this distance. But some former members of the Bennett College team - against whom Washington played - shared memories of her when interviewed in the early 2000s by Rita Liberti, another contributor to the podcast. 
From what they said,external-link Washington was seen as different - as less feminine than the other players. 
While playing for the Tribunes, for the first time in her life Washington started to receive a small salary from sport. But she never was paid enough to give up the day job. 
She would continue working in domestic service as her dual sporting careers wound down, into the 1940s. When the time did come to retire, she didn't bow out quietly. 
In 1936, Washington lost the ATA singles title she'd held since 1929. The next year she won it back. She was 38, it was a fine time to step away. She announced her retirement from tennis singles, and sounded ready. 
""It does not pay to be national champion too long,"" she told the Baltimore African-American in a rare surviving interview. 
""It's the struggle to be one that counts. Once you've arrived, everybody wants to take it away from you.""
However, in 1938 a new force emerged, a young player named Flora Lomax, who seemed to talk up a feud with Washington in the press. 
gs became so heated that in 1939 Washington came out of retirement just to beat Lomax at a tournament in Buffalo, before shortly after retiring again, a remarkable final effort.  
Washington would continue playing doubles tennis though, right up until 1948, when she was 49 or 50. 
Her final title came in the mixed doubles at the ATA championships of 1947. On the opposite side of the net was Althea Gibson, then aged 19. 
In a photo of the pairs posing together, Washington wears long trousers and glasses, almost 30 years senior to the young star standing a few metres away and on the verge of landmark success. Gibson would in 1950 become the first Black player at the US nationals. Six years after that she would win the French Open, the first of her five Grand Slam singles titles.
Washington's final basketball game was played in 1942. But this part of her story speaks of a different kind of decline. 
When she began her basketball career in the '20s, the women's game was played according to the same rules as the men's. It was fast, competitive and physical. 
But by the mid-1930s things were beginning to change, with many of the college teams that formed the women's basketball landscape both in Black and in white sports moving towards what's known as 'participation play', focusing on group exercise rather than competitive action. 
In Washington's earlier career, women's basketball often took up around a third of the sports pages in the Philadelphia Tribune. By 1942, when Washington stepped away from the game at the age of 43 or 44, it had reduced to a trickle. That same year, the Tribunes women's team folded.
In 1950, the US census reports that Washington was sharing an apartment in Philadelphia with her brother Larry. She was still working in domestic service. 
We know Washington was always close with her family. But family seems to become even more central to her in later life. She co-owns this apartment with her sister, there is a cousin close by, and her young nephew JB Childs also spent time living in the same building. 
Years later he hinted to historian Pamela Grundy that his aunt was in a relationship with a woman. As far as we know, Washington never came out publicly, but we believe her sexuality is an important part of her story - and we'll hear from another of her relatives shortly.
Childs also told Grundy about trips back to the farm in Virginia, times of great celebration and joy that are remembered by two other family members in their contribution to our podcast series, Washington's great nephew Gregory Price and her great niece Patricia. 
But in terms of her place - her rightful place - in sporting history and the public consciousness, that began to slip away. So much so that when in 1976 the Black Athletes Hall of Fame sought to honour her, they didn't even know she had died. 
In 1969, two years before Washington's death at the age of 72 or 73, she was interviewed by Len Lear for a story with the Philadelphia Tribune. They met back where it all began for her: at the Germantown YWCA. Lear, now a veteran reporter for that newspaper, had never heard of her. 
""Once I met her and asked a lot of questions, I was absolutely floored,"" he says.
""It's just hard to imagine this today when you see people like Serena Williams, for example, making countless millions and having their name on perfume and all kinds of other products. And she had nothing. Nothing.
""She was getting old and she was not in great health, but to learn that she was possibly the best female athlete in the country in the first half of the 20th century [and] she was doing housekeeping… 
""She did not express anger or rage specifically. She was more or less, I would say, sad. Over what could have been and should have been. 
""She wanted to be recognised for her skills by everyone, and she wasn't.""
Washington's great nephew Gregory Price has another view. He doesn't remember her as sad.
""My sister and I are essentially the last living members of our families who knew her personally, who had actual personal contact with her. We're the last of that,"" he says. 
""You know, she seemed looming large, larger than life. She was tall and slim, she had a baritone voice and beautiful eyes. And when she looked at you, you saw sincerity in her eyes when she spoke.
""My aunt Ora was homosexual, we had no problem with her sexuality… [but] she was reclusive because of that, so I would imagine those who knew of her sexuality suppressed her accomplishments when she was at her best. They refused [to], even the Black community, let alone the white community because of racism back then. 
""They adored her as a player but off the court they refused to acknowledge her because of her sexuality. If she was alive today to see the changes that have taken place - racially, ethnically, sexually, she would be proud to say stand up and say: 'Yes, I'm gay.'
""This is nothing short of a hidden figure story. Someone who played two sports at the highest level, was a champion in both of those sports. [Larry] Bird, [Michael] Jordan, Magic [Johnson]… none of those guys can speak to that. Nobody in sports history.
""Anyone after us, they'll only know her through stories we now tell. I feel like that's my call to action. 
""Tell the story, and the facts will speak for themselves.""","sports","sports"," sports

"/news/uk-england-essex-63207994","An international champion sailor died after a mountain biking accident in Italy, an inquest has heard.
Jamie Mears was taking part in a package cycling tour in the province of Imperia on 6 May when he came off his bike and fell roughly 10 metres (33ft) into a ravine.
46-year-old, from Essex, died from multiple injuries.
Senior coroner Lincoln Brookes, sitting at Chelmsford Coroners' Court, concluded his death was an accident.
""This was a man very much loved and I'm sure there would be many more who would say the same,"" he said.
""I can only describe this as a very tragic accident.""
quest heard that on the group's second day, cycling out of Molini di Triora, they took a different route than planned because of a lorry blocking their path.
No-one saw the moment he came off, but he was believed to have skidded off a wet stone and fallen through shrubbery, which separated the track and the ravine.
His brother, Stewart Mears, was in the group, and he told the court that Mr Mears wore a full-face crash helmet as well as elbow and knee pads.
""It was a pretty innocuous pass and the gradient was pretty shallow. The sort of riding we do isn't extreme,"" said the brother.
""But we weren't aware of the steep drop on this trail.""
Mr Mears was conscious after falling into the ravine and the ambulance service arrived in about 20 minutes, the court heard.

"/news/business-61754394","Rishi Sunak has been accused of failing to act to save billions of taxpayers' money that has been used to pay interest on government debt.
National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank said the losses were due to the Treasury failing to insure against interest rate rises.
It meant higher than necessary payments on £900bn of reserves created through the quantitative easing (QE) programme.
reasury said it was the Bank of England's role to decide QE measures.
Bank of England is independent from the Treasury.
reasury said NIESR's proposal would undermine this independence and be ""hugely damaging"" to the credibility of how public finances were managed.
""Proposals such as this risk undermining the independence of the Bank of England and forcing commercial banks to swap reserves for gilts would be an act of financial repression,"" a Treasury spokesperson said.
NIESR's Prof Jagjit Chadha, told the Financial Times that Mr Sunak's failure to act had left the country with ""an enormous bill and heavy continuing exposure to interest rate risk"".
Bank of England created £895bn of money through quantitative easing. Most of this was used to buy government bonds from pension funds and other investors.
When those investors put the proceeds in commercial bank deposits at the Bank, it had to pay interest at its official interest rate. 
Last year, when the official rate was still 0.1%, NIESR said the government should have insured the cost of servicing this debt against the risk of rising interest rates.
It said interest payments have ""now become much more expensive"" and it estimates the loss over the past year at around £11bn. 
""Such a lost opportunity is an unnecessary cost to the public finances at a very difficult time,"" the think tank said.
It suggested converting the debt into government bonds with longer to pay it back.
""It would have been much better to have reduced the scale of short-term liabilities earlier, as we have argued for some time, and to exploit the benefits of longer-term debt issuance. This is very much a question for the Treasury to answer,"" said Prof Chadha.
reasury said it would not have been commercially viable to convert such a high level of debt.
""The £11bn figure is based on the implausible assumption that it would be possible to undertake action of this scale in a single transaction,"" it added.
While there never was a single moment where the Treasury made a decision that cost the nation £11bn, the analysis from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research does point to some costly missed opportunities.
Early last year the Treasury itself was pointing towards the shortening maturity of our national debt as a by-product of the pandemic expansion of borrowing and the Bank of England's QE policy.  The UK has for the past two decades had, by international standards, many more years to repay its loans from the markets, but that was no longer the case. The Treasury was trying to explain why despite the UK borrowing record sums, interest costs were at record lows.
So a question arose - why don't they do something about it and lock-in then rock bottom interest rates for many years? It was suggested by NIESR, by Policy Exchange, by Boris Johnson's former economic adviser Gerard Lyons, among others.
reasury's answer is that to have done so would have interfered with the Bank of England's independence over its QE programme of buying bonds, and that it would have been commercially unviable to refinance £600bn of debt in the markets in one go. In addition, though we all know now that there has been a material rise in interest rates, back then, it would have been a bet. 
In short, they say, they could not have done the transaction that would have ""saved £11bn"", and with the benefit of hindsight they might also have put money into gas futures or the used car market and ""saved"" many tens of billions more.
But the wider point does raise questions about missed opportunities. And as we enter a new era of rising interest rates, and the reversal of QE, or Quantitative Tightening, many of the fuzzy accounting questions over government debts could have a rather material impact on the economic numbers.
Gerard Lyons, the former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson when the prime minister was Mayor of London, tweeted that the issue was ""all too predictable"". 
Dr Lyons, now a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think tank, said the ""UK should've locked into low rates, borrowing more longer dated debt and not over reliance on QE to fund the deficit"". 
But Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, tweeted that the ""£11bn 'cost' should really be set against the £120bn 'benefit' that the QE process has so far yielded for the Exchequer"".
""To be fair to NIESR in their paper of last year they do acknowledge this - but this seems to have been drowned out today.""
Labour's shadow treasury minister Tulip Siddiq said: ""These are astronomical sums for the chancellor to lose, and leaves working people picking up the cheque for his severe wastefulness while he hikes their taxes in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.
""This government has played fast and loose with taxpayers' money. Britain deserves a government that respects public money and delivers for people across the country.""","politics","politics"," politics

"/news/uk-64116416","UK government is reviewing whether to introduce Covid restrictions on visitors from China, the defence secretary has said.
Ben Wallace said the Department for Transport would take medical advice and talk to the Department of Health.
Earlier, an ex-health minister urged the government to consider testing arrivals from China for Covid.
A number of countries are introducing mandatory testing in response to China's coronavirus surge. 
Asked whether the government would consider restrictions, Mr Wallace said: ""The government is looking at that, it's under review, we noticed obviously what the US has done and India and I think Italy has looked at it.""
""We keep under review all the time, obviously, health threats to the UK, wherever they may be.""
Several countries - including the US, Japan, Italy and Malaysia - are now enforcing testing on visitors from China. 
follows a surge in cases in China after Beijing's decision to effectively end its zero-Covid policy.
UK Health Minister Will Quince said he knew that many people would be concerned ""about the news coming out of China"" and the government was taking the situation ""incredibly seriously"".
However, there was ""no evidence at this point of a new variant from China"", which he said would be the ""key threat"".
""At the moment the variant that is in China currently is already prevalent here in the UK.""
Meanwhile, the Scottish government said it currently has no plans to change travel requirements, and would continue to work with the UK Health Security Agency and other countries to ""monitor the spread of harmful variants"".
In 2019, 813,532 visas were issued to people wanting to travel to the UK from China. This dropped to less than 200,000 over the following two years, owing to Beijing's strict Covid border controls. 
re are concerns that a new variant may emerge in China and that international travel could quickly spread it. 
When there is lots of virus circulating in any population, there will be opportunities for it to change or mutate in potentially harmful ways.
Covid is circulating in lots of countries around the world. 
According to latest estimates for the UK, one in every 45 people in Britain is infected. 
Vaccines are saving lives but they can't stop infections. Instead, experts are tracking the virus and seeing if the vaccines need updating to be a better match for any significant new mutations. 
So far, science is keeping up with the virus and there are no particularly worrying new variants. 
Lord Bethell, who was health minister during the pandemic, told the BBC there was a good reason to look at testing people when they land, a policy Italy has adopted.    
""What the Italians are doing is post-flight surveillance of arrivals in Italy, in order to understand whether there are any emerging variants and to understand the impact of the virus on the Italian health system,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""That is a sensible thing to do and something the British government should be seriously looking at.""
China is reporting about 5,000 cases a day, but analysts say such numbers are vastly undercounted - and the daily caseload may be closer to one million.
Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he did not think the current situation in China was likely to generate many more Covid cases in the UK or generally across the globe.
While China was in a ""dark"" and ""difficult"" place, the current evidence suggested the particular variant causing most infections in the country was ""very common elsewhere in the world"", he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme on Wednesday. The UK has seen many such cases since it appeared in the summer, he added.
On Wednesday, the US said a lack of ""adequate and transparent"" Covid data in China had contributed to the decision to require Covid tests from 5 January for travellers entering the country from China, Hong Kong and Macau.
Others have also announced restrictions:
On Thursday, Italy urged the rest of the EU to follow its lead and ensure Chinese arrivals were tested. However, the EU's disease agency said the surge in cases in China was not expected to impact members states and said screening travellers from China for Covid would be ""unjustified"".
Beijing's foreign ministry has said coronavirus rules should only be put in place on a ""scientific"" basis and accused Western countries and media of ""hyping up"" the situation.
China only announced on Monday its decision to end quarantine for arrivals - effectively reopening travel in and out of the country for the first time since March 2020. ","health","politics"," politics

Norwich Puppet Theatre is the recipient of waste created by a greetings card company in the city.
Company Dynamic Print's waste is being turned into papier mache puppets and scenery at the venue.
Print company director Sarah Smith, said it was ""common sense"" to use their waste to help other people, and added, ""it doesn't cost anything for me"".
Upcycle Your Waste is a scheme being run by Norwich Business Improvement Business (BID) and is designed to take waste produced by Norwich businesses, and turn it in to something new.
Companies taking part are trying to show that if you pull the right strings, what might seem useless to one business, can be more than useful to another.
Dynamic Print had been turning its waste cardboard into recyclable bubble wrap and now its scrap paper is also being upcycled. 
Instead of paying £60 each month to dispose of it, it is being given to local businesses.
""It's common sense. Upcycling, recycling - is a key ingredient going forward and to be able to help other people with my waste - it doesn't cost anything for me,"" said Ms Smith.
Puppet Theatre administrator, Molly Farley, said: ""It's amazing that all these people are coming out of the woodwork; all these businesses have been here all along but we've always needed a link-up to make things happen.""
BBC TV adventurer, presenter and author, Simon Reeve, was at Norwich City's Carrow Road stadium giving a talk to the BID organisation about his career and sustainability.

"/news/entertainment-arts-63230643","Masterpieces by some of art's most renowned painters have gone on display before what's expected to be the largest auction in history.
re collectively expected to fetch a record-breaking $1bn (£900m) at the sale in New York next month.
works belonged to Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who died in 2018.
But while Allen often loaned out his treasures, some art critics fear the auction could lead the works to become hidden from public view for decades.
Paintings by Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, Paul Cezanne and David Hockney feature in the collection, which is being auctioned by Christie's.
150 works will be on public display in the coming weeks at branches of Christie's worldwide, before being auctioned in New York on 9 and 10 November. 
Fourteen of the paintings will be on display in London this weekend, with other exhibitions set to take place in Paris, Los Angeles and Shanghai.
While some of the artists come up in auctions relatively often, Allen's collection features pieces that are considered some of the painters' masterpieces.  
Max Carter, head of impressionist and modern art at Christie's, described it as a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" auction.
""I don't think we've had anything like this in terms of masterpiece range across 500 years,"" he told BBC News. ""If you look at the top dozen or so works in the collection, each one of these objects would be a five-year or 10-year defining work if they were to come on the market on their own.""
He added: ""The art collecting was very personal [to Allen], in spite of the staggering range - it's 500 years from late 15th Century works by Botticelli through to works executed in the 2010s. 
""The common thread is this one man's vision. There was no advisor, this was something that he did himself, and buying at the highest levels, decisively and virtually without mistakes, which is something you very seldom see.""
works on display in London include: 
When he was alive, Allen often loaned his artworks to museums and touring exhibitions. ""He was very generous,"" said Giovanna Bertazzoni, co-chairman of Christie's impressionist and modern art department. ""He wasn't private or secluded with the collection. It was always an endeavour that he wanted to share.""
But some arts experts fear that the buyers may hang them on the walls of their homes and restrict them from public view. 
Melanie Gerlis, Financial Times columnist and editor-at-large of The Art Newspaper, said: ""It's always a bit painful to watch works that have been in museum shows - or indeed on long loan to collections - go into the private market, where they may not be seen again by the public.
""But the truth is that to buy work at these price levels is beyond the reach of museums, so they are always in some way reliant on the generosity of private, wealthy patrons. 
""I am sure though that many of the next owners the Allen works will be those who are accustomed to lending to museums - and frankly not just for charitable reasons. As most collectors know, a museum showing can greatly add to the value of the work that they own!""
Asked whether she was concerned that public access to the works could be limited, Ms Bertazzoni said: ""I have the same kind of hopes that they will end up in museums. Most of them will be competed for by museums, there are museums that can afford them and they will be in the game. 
""American collectors are all driven by donating, eventually, to the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art], to the MoMA [Museum of Modern Art]. It's part of the American tradition. So I really do hope that these works will go back to public fruition.""
money raised by the auction will be distributed between a variety of philanthropic causes Allen supported.
Allen was a conservationist, and his own foundation aimed to protect oceans and promote biodiversity. During his lifetime, he was also passionate about supporting education, the arts, wildlife, science and technology.","entertainment","business"," business

"/news/technology-62124094","Department of Health has been reprimanded over ministers' and officials' use of messaging apps and private email during the pandemic.
Using WhatsApp and other apps had meant information on the handling of the pandemic could have been lost, the Information Commissioner's Office said.
It has asked government to carry out a review of the use of private messaging, 
government told BBC News the ICO had found the channels it used had been ""lawful"".
But its use of encrypted apps and private email has been criticised, as messages might not be provided to people making Freedom of Information requests.
Last year, campaigners brought a case to the High Court, saying these services made it easier to delete information and cover up possible wrongdoing.
But in April judges decided the law on keeping public records said ""nothing"" about using personal devices for government business.
ruled using autodelete software was lawful.
Also last year, the then information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, launched an investigation into the use of these private channels by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) during the pandemic.
At the time, Ms Denham said: ""My worry is that information in private email accounts or messaging services is forgotten, overlooked, autodeleted or otherwise not available when a Freedom of Information request is later made.""
results of this inquiry have now been published in a report, Behind the screens.
re was, it says, ""extensive"" use of private correspondence channels by ministers and staff. 
Staff used:
And the DHSC's policies and procedures were inconsistent with existing policy on the use of private email.
Using private channels of communication did not in itself constitute a breach of either Freedom of Information or data-protection rules, the report says, if there were ""sufficient controls in place"" to allow information to be given when requested.
""The investigation found, however, that such controls were lacking,"" the ICO said.
report also questions the security of private messaging channels, while noting instant messaging brought ""some real operational benefits"" during the pandemic.
As a result of its investigation, the ICO issued a reprimand requiring the DHSC to improve its ""handling of personal information through private correspondence channels and ensure information is kept secure"".
Current information commissioner John Edwards said he understood the value of instant communication but ""public officials should be able to show their workings, for both record-keeping purposes and to maintain public confidence"". 
""That is how trust in those decisions is secured and lessons are learned for the future,"" he said.
""The broader point is making sure the Freedom of Information Act keeps working to ensure public authorities remain accountable to the people they serve.""
UK Covid-19 Inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, will also consider how information was recorded by the government during the pandemic.
government told BBC News it would carefully consider the ICO report but was glad it had made clear the correspondence channels used were lawful.
""Ministers and officials had to work at extraordinary pace during the pandemic and the use of modern technology was necessary to deliver important public services that saved lives,"" an official said.

But Iain Overton, of public-service journalist body The Citizens, which brought the earlier unsuccessful High Court action, told BBC News government had been ruling ""more and more in the shadows, refusing to acknowledge they are increasingly running the country on personal, encrypted messaging systems"".
""This poses not just a problem for journalists - Freedom of Information Act requests for such messages are consistently refused,"" he said.

It has been submitted to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. 
A decision on whether it will be added to the UK's Tentative List of World Heritage sites is expected early next year.
A report, by marine and coastal habitat consultants ABPmer, found the east coast had ""outstanding universal value"" due its world class network of coastal wetlands which support globally important migratory bird populations, the RSPB said.  
One billion birds are reliant on the area, which covers 420,079 acres (170,000 hectares), each winter to shelter from the harsh conditions in Scandinavia, Canada, Greenland and Siberia. 
relines include a ""a rich buffet of invertebrates"" for birds to feed on, and its marshes are places to fish and for tourists to visit, the report said.
Adam Rowlands, RSPB England area manager for Suffolk, said: ""In Suffolk the coastal estuaries will be welcoming large numbers of dark-bellied brent geese, avocet, black-tailed godwit and knot for the winter, whilst coastal marshes will ring to the whistling cries of wigeon, rubbing shoulders with beautiful pintail and white-fronted geese.""

"/news/business-62408117","It is the most piercing of warning sirens set off by the Bank of England.
It announced the largest interest rate rise in a quarter of a century, in an attempt to temper a peak in inflation of 13%.
But it is its prediction of a recession as long as the great financial crisis and as deep as that seen in the early 1990s that is the big shock here.
Bank thinks that energy bills hitting nearly £300 per month on average, treble their level of a year before, will plunge the economy in the final quarter of this year into a recession.
If global energy costs remain where they are, that recession will then last the whole of next year, with inflation barely below 10% even in a year's time.
roper full fat recession now being predicted by the Bank, and at the same time a 42-year high in the rate of inflation. 
It is a textbook example of the combination of stagnation of the economy and high inflation - stagflation.
It obviously will raise questions as to why rates are being hiked into a recession, at a time when consumers are already pulling back from spending. 
Mortgage costs are now soaring. Markets expect further rises in the base rate - taking it up to 3% - even during this predicted recession.
ffects those on variable rates, and about half of those set to come off their fixed rate mortgages in the coming couple of years. 
Bank's answer will be that rates are still low by historic standards, and they just cannot provide further fuel for these extraordinary but hopefully temporary high inflation rates, to last for years.
But make no mistake, a forecast such as this, would mean a wrecking ball to the forecasts for government borrowing. Tax revenues would plummet, and spending would increase naturally. 
Forget about the £30bn room for manoeuvre or ""fiscal headroom"" we heard so much about. 
But with this level of energy shock, whoever is in power, would need to prepare further massive consumer support, and feasibly, rescue schemes for the energy sector too. 
I cannot recall the Bank of England predicting a recession of this length in advance of the event.
And that certainly has not happened in the middle of the selection of a new prime minister. It is the sort of forecast that in other circumstances might have prompted an immediate emergency Budget. 
It may just upend all the plans we have heard so much about.","business","business"," business

But Covid deaths over the past three months are running at about 40% of the numbers in the same period last year.
Deaths from all causes have been above normal  for 16 of the past 17 weeks. 
re have been more than 1,000 so-called ""excess"" deaths from all causes in Wales  - above what we might expect to see in the years before Covid - since July. Of these, 447 do not involve Covid. 
re have been suggestions that there could be several reasons for this - from people becoming less healthy during the pandemic, to not seeking or waiting longer for medical help for health issues.
Coronavirus in Wales - the latest in numbers

Covid accounted for 6.2% of all deaths in Wales in the latest week, more than the proportion in England (5.5%).

Across Wales and England, 85% of Covid deaths in the latest week involved those aged over 70.
Deaths due to Covid have also exceeded deaths due to flu and pneumonia for the past four weeks.
umber of deaths involving Covid - in which it was mentioned on the death certificate as a contributory factor - is 11,029 in Wales, since March 2020.

Conservative health spokesman Russell George MS repeated his party's call for a ""badly needed"" Welsh-specific inquiry into the pandemic, to ensure that we ""limit the spread of viruses like this in future and get the answers people deserve"".
He added: ""It is tragic that coronavirus continues to take a toll on our society with every one of those 11,000 being an individual who leaves behind family and friends who cared for them and will miss them.""
registered deaths follow a period in early October when Covid infections in the community were estimated to have increased.
But now infections are falling again, while those in hospital being primarily treated for the virus remain at low levels.
ONS estimates are that one in 40 people - or 72,400 - are estimated to have had Covid in the latest week.
2.38% of the population.
-called R-number - or reproduction number - which estimates the spread of infection is also going down.
Meanwhile, Covid vaccine autumn boosters have now reached 80% of care home residents and 69% of the over 65s, according to Public Health Wales figures.
Wales has reached proportionately more of key groups with autumn boosters than England, although numbers are down on earlier phases of the programme and weekly numbers are down by a third on a month ago.","health","health"," health
