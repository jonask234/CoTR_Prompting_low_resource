https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-54655423,"Bajeti ya uchaguzi ni moja kati ya masuala ya msingi zaidi ambayo huenda yakachangia shughuli za uchaguzi kwenda kwa uafinisi ama kusuasua. Katika uchaguzi wa nchi nyingi zinazoendelea hasa Barani Afrika, fedha za kuendesha shughuli nzima ya uchaguzi huegemea zaidi michango na misaada kutoka nchi zilizoendelea ama mashirika makubwa duniani kama benki ya dunia na mashirika ya kimataifa. Na kiasi kingine cha fedha hutolewa na serikali ya nchi husika. Tanzania inatarajia kufanya uchaguzi mkuu mwishoni mwa mwezi huu Oktoba 28. Na tofauti na miaka iliyopita, bajeti ya uchaguzi ya mwaka huu inatolewa yote na serikali ya Tanzania. Bila kusubiri msaada wa mashirika wa nchi za nje, Tanzania ilitangaza kuwa uchaguzi utagharamiwa na serikali ya nchi hiyo kwa asilimia 100. Kwa mujibu wa tume ya taifa ya uchaguzi NEC Serikali ya Tanzania imetenga kiasi cha shilingi za kitanzania Bilioni 331 wakati wa uchaguzi, na maandalizi ya uchaguzi yakigharimu shilingi za kitanzania bilioni 157. Mkurugenzi wa uchaguzi kutoka Tume ya taifa ya uchaguzi Dr Wilson Mahera amesema kuwa tayari serikali imetoa fedha zote za kuendesha uchaguzi huu. ''Hadi sasa tumepewa fedha kwa asilimia kubwa, hatujaenda kuomba nje na mataifa ya nje yanasema vipi mbona hamuji kuomba?'' Kwa upande wa Zanzibar, Mkurugenzi wa Uchaguzi kutoka tume ya uchaguzi Zanzibar (ZEC) Thabit Idarous Faina amebainisha kuwa kwa mara ya Kwanza Serikali ya Mapinduzi ya Zanzibar imetumia bajeti yote ya Uchaguzi kwa ukamilifu bila kutumia fedha zozote kutoka kwa wafadhili. Uchaguzi wa mwaka 1995 uligharamiwa na serikali pamoja na wafadhili. Lakini kwa mujibu wa ripoti ya Tume ya taifa ya uchaguzi NEC kwa uchaguzi wa mwaka 1995, bajeti ilisuasua kutokana na kubadilika kwa sharia hivyo NEC walipaswa kutoa zaidi ya matarajio yao. Na pia masuala ya kifedha na bajeti ya uchaguzi ilipangwa mwaka 1994 hivyo ilivyofika wakati wa uchaguzi machache yaliweza kubadilika. Changamoto nyingine iliyokumba uchaguzi wa mwaka 1995, ni serikali ya Tanzania kusuasua kupeleka fedha kwa wakati kwa tume ya taifa ya uchaguzi. Kwa Mujibu wa ripoti ya NEC 2001, katika uchaguzi wa mwaka 2000 Tume ya taifa ya uchaguzi ilijipanga vizuri kutokana na mafunzo waliyoyapata kupitia matatizo  yalitokea katika uchaguzi wa mwaka 1995. NEC iliandaa bajeti mwaka 1998 na kupata fedha kutoka serikali na nyingine ikitoka kwa wafadhili waliokusanya kupitia shirika la Kidanishi. Kwa miaka mingine ya uchaguzi wa Tanzania, 2005,2010 na 2015 fedha za bajeti ya uchaguzi ilitolewa kwa kiasi kikubwa na serikali lakini pia wafadhili na mashirika ya kimataifa. Kwa upande wa uchaguzi wa serikali ya mapinduzi Zanzibar na kwa mujibu ripoti ya uchaguzi ya ZEC mwaka 1995, zaidi ya nusu ya gharama ya uchaguzi wa mwaka 1995 ilitolewa na serikali ya mapinduzi ya Zanzibar na wafadhili wakachangia kupitia shirika la Kidanishi (DANIDA) na fedha nyingine ikiwa na kiasi cha dola za Kimarekani 13,500 zikitoka serikali ya Uingereza na kukabidhiwa tume ya uchaguzi Zanzibar (ZEC). Hivyo hivyo kwa uchaguzi wa mwaka 2005, 2010 fedha zilitoka kwa wafadhili, mashirika ya kimataifa na serikali ya mapinduzi ya Zanzibar. Suala kuu la kujitegemea katika uchaguzi linaonekana kuwa ni kupunguza msukumo kutoka kwa wafadhili wa kufanya maamuzi kutokana na kulipa fadhila ya gharama za uchaguzi. '' Tunataka kuwa huru ili tuweze kusimamia uchaguzi wetu bila masharti, na hizi zote tumezipokea kutoka serikali ya awamu ya tano'' anasema mkurugenzi wa uchaguzi kutoka tume ya taifa ya uchaguzi Dkt.Wilson Mahera. Kama ilivyo kwa Tanzania kuna baadhi ya nchi za Afrika kwa mara ya kwanza wamejigharamia bajeti za uchaguzi. Katika uchaguzi uliopita wa  Jamhuri ya Demokrasia ya Congo  nayo Serikali ilitanganza kujitegemea kwa asilimia 100. Msemaji wa serikali Lambert Mende aliiambia Reuters kuwa hakuna nchi duniani inataka kuingiliwa katika kufanikisha zoezi la uhuru. Aidha Mende aliongeza kuwa hawataki kuigiliwa katika masuala ya demokrasia, kama wanataka kutoa msaada basi wapeleke katika sekta nyingine kama Afya na elimu. Kwa upande wa Burundi, hadi mwaka 2015 walikua wakitegemea wafadhili kugharamia uchaguzi , baada ya Rais Nkurunzinza kushinda muhula wa tatu na kutokea kwa machafuko nchini humo, wafadhili wakasitisha kutoa misaada. Aliyekua waziri wa mambo ya ndani Pascal Barandagiye, serikali itakusanya michango nyumba kwa nyumba hadi fedha ya uchaguzi ipatikane. Katika harakati za kuchangia fedha hizo haki za binadamu zilikiukwa nchini Burundi. Kwa mujibu wa ripoti ya shirika la haki za binadamu la Human rights watch vikosi vya usalama vilikua vikilazimisha watu kulipa mchango huo kwa kutumia nguvu na kuchangia zaidi ya mara moja. Kwa nchi hizi za Afrika, mara nyingi hutemegemea misaada kutoka kwa wafadhili na mikopo kutoka mashirika makubwa duniani.Swali kubwa linabaki, Je Kuanza kujitegemea katika suala la msingi kama uchaguzi hutasaidia nchi hizi kuacha utegemezi wa kiuchumi?","'The election budget is one of the many issues that have changed the nature of the election process towards more professionalism and independence.

Awamu hiyo ya chanjo inakuja baada ya nchi hiyo kupokea chanjo ainia ya Johnson and Johnson zaidi ya dozi milioni moja kutoka Marekani chini ya mpango wa Covax, pia chanjo nyingine zaidi ya milioni moja aina ya Sinopham kutoka China. Rais wa Tanzania, Samia Suluhu Hassan ametangaza awamu hiyo ya chanjo alipohutubia mkutano wa hadhara mjini Arusha Kaskazini mwa nchi hiyo na kusema chanjo za awamu ya kwanza zimetumika kwa asilimia 88. Hata hivyo, hakutaja aina ya chanjo inayotarajiwa kupokewa. Chini ya Rais Samia aliyechukua madaraka Machi 19 mwaka huu, Serikali imeweka msisitizo wa chanjo kama moja ya njia muhimu za kukabilianana UVIKO-19. Mtangulizi wa Samia, John Magufuli aliyefariki Machi 17 alikuwa na msimamo tofauti juu ya chanjo huku akielekeza wataalamu wake kujiridhisha, akidai baadhi ya chanjo si salama kwa watanzania. Hata hivyo hali ilibadilika Julai 28 mwaka huu ambapo Rais wa Tanzania Samia Suluhu Hassan binafsi alipata chanjo dhidi ya Corona . Samia aliwaongoza maafisa wengine wa serikali wakiwemo Waziri mkuu Kassim Majaaliwa kupokea chanjo hiyo . Katika uzinduzi wa hafla ya chanjo chini humo rais Samia alisema  serikali yake itahakikisha kwamba kila mtanzania nayetaka kuchanjwa anapata chanjo hiyo . 'Mimi ni mama ya watoto wanne,mimi ni bibi wa wajukuu kadhaa na pia mimi ni mke ..siwezi kujiweka katika hatari … Nimekubali kwa hiyari yangu na najua ndani ya mwili wangu nina chanjo kadhaa na nimeishi nazo kwa miaka karibu 61' alisema rais Samia kabla ya kuchanjwa. Katika hotba yake wakati wa uzinduzi huo rais Samia aliwataka wananchi kuendelea kuchukua tahadhari dhidi ya ugonjwa huo akisema kuna walioathiriwa na kuwapoteza jamaa zao ambao wangefurahia kuipata chanjo hiyo mapema. ' Wakati gonjwa hili linapokuguza ndipo utajua hatari yake…nenda Moshi,nenda Kagera ,nenda Arusha..wana maneno ya kukuambia' alisema Rais Samia.","'Tanzania will continue to receive three doses of the UVIKO-19 vaccine after receiving two initial doses to combat the virus.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/59724114,"Wiki hii Muungano wa Ulaya, EU uliliwekea vikwazo Kundi la Wagner, ambao ni muungano wa mamluki wa Urusi wanaolaumiwa kwa ukiukaji wa haki za binadamu katika Jamhuri ya Afrika ya Kati, CAR.  Muungano wa Ulaya sasa unasema huwezi tena kuwapa mafunzo wanajeshi wa serikali  ya CAR kwa sababu ya uhusiano wao na kundi la Wagner.  Barani Afrika wapiganaji wake pia wako nchini Libya, Sudan na Musumbiji na wanaonekana kuwa na wajibu nchini Mali.  Mamluki hao wapo CAR kumsaidia Rais Faustin-Archange Touadéra kuwapiga vita waasi, ambao bado wanadhibiti sehemu nyingi za nchi licha ya mafanikio ya hivi majuzi ya serikali.  Nchi hiyo imekumbwa na vita vya wenyewe  kwa wenyewe tangu Rais François Bozizé alipopinduliwa mwaka 2013.  Bw Touadéra, ambaye amekuwa madarakani tangu mwaka 2016, amekuwa na wakati mgumu kuwashinda waasi licha ya uwepo wa wanajeshi wa Ufaransa  na vikosi vya Umoja wa Mataifa.  Serikali ya CAR inaamini kuwa mamluki wa Urusi wamekuwa na mafanikio makubwa.  Kundi la Wagner linaamiwa kuanza shughuli zake nchini CAR mwaka 2017, baada ya baraza la Ulinzi la Umoja wa Mataifa kuidhinisha  huduma za utoaji mafunzo za Urusi nchini humo na kuondoa vikwazo vya silaha vilivyotangazwa mwaka 2013.  Oktoba 2017, Rais Touadéra alisafiri kwenda Urusi kusaini makubaliano kadhaa ya usalama na serikali ya Urusi.  Hii ilijumuisha ombi la msaada  wa kijeshi, kwa ahadi ya kupata migodi  ya madini ya almasi, dhahabu na urani nchini CAR.  Umoja wa Mataifa ulikuwa umekubaliana kutumwa watoa mafunzo 175 wa Urusi kwa jeshi la CAR. Licha ya Urusi kukana, kuna shutuma zikiwemo kutoka Muungano wa Ulaya kuwa kuna ushirika kati ya Wagner na serikali ya Urusi.  Wachambuzi wanasema uhusiano huu ulisabisha kundi la Wagner kuanza kufanya kazi nchini CAR baada ya makubaliano na Urusi kusainiwa.  Tangu wakati huo uwepo wa kundi hili katika taifa hilo lenye utajiri wa madini umeongezeka.  Urusi inasema kuwa imetuma watoa mafuzno wasio na silaha nchini CAR na zaidi ya 550 hawajakuwepo nchini humo kwa wakati mmoja.  Hata hivyo wataalamu wa umoja wa Mataifa wanaamini kuwa huenda kuna watoa mafunzo zaidi ya 2,000 waliotumwa na Urusi nchini CAR, wakiwemo wengine kutoka Syria na Libya ambapo Kundi la Wagner limekuwa likihudumu.  Hili linazua wasi wasi kwa UN na Ufaransa ambao wote wanalilaumu kundi hilo kwa kuchochea mzozo na kwa kutekeleza ukiukaji wa haki za binadamu  na mauaji ya kiholela  kwa wale wanaokisiwa kuwa waasi.   Kundi la Wagner na vikosi vya serikali, vimebaka  na kuwaibia raia maeneo ya vijijini, kwa mujibu wa UN na Ufaransa.  Kwenye ripoti ya mwezi Agosti  kuhusu haki za binadamu nchini CAR, Umoja wa Mataifa ulirekodi zaidi ya visa 500 kuanzia Julai 2020. Kati ya hizo yalikuwepo mauaji ya kiholela, mateso na ukatili wa kingono.  Mwezi Oktoba, jopo la wataalamu wa Umoja wa Mataifa lilisema wale waliokamatwa na watoa mafunzo wa Urusi na pia jeshi la Serikali mara nyingi hawakupata haki.  Mapema mwezi huu, waziri wa masuala ya sheria nchini CAR Arnaud Abazene alikiri kwa mara ya kwanza kuwa ukatili uliendeshwa na watoa mafunzo  wa Urusi.  Huku akisema kuwa visa vingine vilitekelezwa na waasi, ilikuwa ndio mara ya kwanza serikali ilikiri kuwa ukatili ilifanywa na wanajeshi wake au washirika.   Msemaji wa EU Nabila Massrali aliiambia BBC kuwa muungano huo una wasi wasi kutokana na vitendo vya kundi la Wagner. Sawa na shutuma nchini CAR,  Umoja wa Mataifa umelaumu kundi la Wagner kwa kuendesha uhalifu wa kivita nchini Libya.  Uchunguzi wa BBC ulifichua kuwa watu kutoka Kundi la Wagner waliwaua raia na wafungwa nchini Libya na kutega milipuko.  EU kwa sasa imefuta shughuli zake za utoaji mafunzo nchini CAR kufuatia wasi wasi kuwa mamluki hao walikuwa wakiongoza vikosi vilivyopewa mafunzo na EU.  EU ni mmoja wa wafadhili wakubwa wa misaada ya kibinadamu kwa CAR baada ya kutoa zaidi ya dola bilioni 1.6 tangu mwaka 2014.   Hamna ushirika rasmi lakini kuna tuhuma kuwa kuna uhusiano wa karibu.  Kati ya wake waliowekewa vikwazo na EU ni Valery Zakharov, mwanachama wa zamani wa idara ya usalama ya seriakli nchini Urusi, na mshauri wa masuala ya ulinzi kwa rais Touadéra.  Kulingana na EU Bw Zakharov ni muhusika mkuu kwenye kundi la Wagner na amedumisha uhusiano wa karibu na serikali ya Urusi.  Wagner lilipata umaarufu mwaka 2014 wakati lilikuwa likipigana na waasi waliokuwa wakiungwa mkono na Urusi kwenye mzozo mashariki mwa Ukraine. Tangu wakati huo kundi hilo limeendesha shughuli zake mashariki ya kati sawia na Afrika ya kati na pia kusini mwa Afrika.  Linaaminiwa kufadhiliwa na Yevgeny Prigozhin, mfanyabiashara tajiri aliye na uhusiano na Rais Vladimir Putin. Bw Prigozhi amekanusha kila mara uhusiano wake na Kundi la Wagner.  Kando na Libya, EU pia imesema mamluki wa Wagner wanaendesha oparesheni zao nchini Sudan na Musumbiji.   Nchini Sudan wanaaminiwa kuhusika kwenye utaoaji mafunzo na kuwalinda maafisa na pia migodi.  Nchini Musumbiji, Wagner imewasaidia wanajeshi kwenye vita dhidi ya wanamgambo wa kiislamu kaskazini mwa nchi.  Hivi majuzi, Mali, mshirika wa miaka mingi wa nchi za magharibu kwenye vita dhidi  ya makundi ya jihadi huko Sahel, ilisema inataka kuwaajiri wanachama 1,000 wa Wagner kusaidia kutoa usalama.  Hii ilifuatia tangazo la Ufaransa kuwa itaondoa karibu nusu ya wanajeshi wake 5,000 kutoka nchi hiyo.  Waziri wa mashauri ya nchi za kigeni nchini Mali Abdoulaye Diop, anasema jitihada za jamii ya kimataifa hazijafanikiwa na hivyo nchi itachukua hatua mpya.  Kuingia kwa Wagner nchini Mali inawakumbusha waangalizi wengine jinsi kundi hilo lilianza kuhudumu nchini CAR.","kundi la Wagner kwa kuwa wanaendesha kutoa usalama nchini CAR, kwa sababu ya uhusiano wao na kundi la Wagner.

Hali hii imewafanya baadhi ya watu kujiuliza kuhusu maisha yake ya kawaida yako vipi? Rais wa Urusi Vladimir Putin ni mtu wa kuamka kuchelewa asubuhi na hupata kifungua kinywa karibu saa sita za mchana. Kwa kawaida hula kiwango kikubwa cha mayai ya kukaangwa kunywa uji ambao huandaliwa ndani ya bakuli pana pamoja na mayai ya kwale pamoja na sharubati ya matunda pembeni. Taarifa za gazeti la Newsweek reports nchini Urusi zinaripoti kuwa viungo vya chakula chake anachokula   ""mara kwa mara hutoka katika mashamba ya kiongozi wa  kidini wa Waothordox wa Urusi  Patriarch Kirill.""Na mara anapomaliza mlo wake, hunywa kikombe cha kahawa. Kinachofuata baada ya mlo, ni muda wa mazoezi ya mwili.  Gazeti la  Newsweek  nchini humo liliripoti kuwa Bw Putin hutumia muda wa saa mbili  kuogelea. Na anapokuwa ndani ya maji hufikiria mambo mengi kuihusu nchi yake Urusi . Baada ya kukamilisha mizunguko mingi ndani ya maji, Putin huwa haishii hapo, bali huingia katika ukumbi wa mazoezi (gym) na kuanza kunyenyua vyuma. Rais huyu mwenye umri wa miaka 65 anasemekana kuwa makini sana kujenga muonekano wa mwili wake sawa na wanamichezo, na hivyo kuonekana kuwa na umbo la kiume ambalo wengi wamekuwa wakilitaja kuwa lenye mvuto. Rais Putin ni mhafidhina, na ikapokuja katika chaguo lake la mavazi, hupendelea suti zilizoshonwa kwa mtindo wake aliouchagua mwenyewe, manukato pamoja na tai za nembo ya Valentino. Mwaka 2015, alipigwa picha akifanya mazoezi na waziri Mkuu wa Urusi   Dmitry Medvedev. Kulingana na taarifa ya Esquire , mavazi yake ya mazoezi yalikwa na gharama ya dola 3,200. Wavuti unaomilikiwa na taifa la Urusi - Russia Beyond the Headlines unaripoti kuwa nembo za mavazi anazopendelea Bw Putin   Kiton na Brioni. Rais huyu wa Urusi kwa kawaida huwa hafiki kazini mpaka  baada ya saa sita mchana.  Kwanza huketi chini kwenye dawati lake kusoma maelezo ya taarifa zilizowasilishwa kwake zikiwemo za ujasusi. Taarifa hizi ni pamoja na za ujasusi wa ndani ya nchi na masuala ya kigeni, pamoja na kusikiliza baadhi ya sauti zilizorekodiwa kutoka kwa vyombo vya habari vya Urusi na vya kimataifa. Mara moja moja, mshauri wake humuonesha video ya mtandaoni  ya kumdhihaki  yeye na serikali yake. Rais wa Urusi ni mtu wa kufanya kazi sana usiku na mara nyingi huchelewa sana kulala akifanya kazi. Hufanya kazi zake vyema usiku, uliandika mtandao wa habari wa  Urusi  wa Newsweek. Wakati anaposafiri nje ya nchi, ratiba ya Rais Putin  ya siku huwa imesheheni mambo mengi zaidi. Kokote anakopokelewa  kila kitu hubadilishwa kuanzia shuka, sabuni, vifaa vya usafi  hadi mabakuli ya matunda. Putin pia huwa hakubali chakula kilichoandaliwa na mwenyeji wake ambacho hakijaidhinishwa na  Kremlin. Awali jarida la The Telegraph liliripoti kuwa chakula anachokipenda zaidi Bw Putin ni Ice Cream aina ya  pistachio . Aliwahi pia kumpatia zawadi rais wa uchina  Xi Jinping  aina hiyo ya  ice cream wakati wa mkutano wa   G20 summit wa mwaka 2017. Miaka kadhaa iliyopita mgahawa wa  St. Petersburg   Podvorye ulikuwa na menyu iliyoitwa -Mlo wa mchana wa Vladimir Putin ""The Lunch of Vladimir Putin"" -  ambao ulitengeneza chakula alichokipenda raisi huyo wa Urusi.

Ratiba ya kazi yake siku za wikendi huwa haina mambo mengi ya kufanya, ili kumpatia muda Bw Putin kuhudhuria mafunzo yake ya lugha ya Kiingereza. Jumapili wakati mwingine husali na kuungama.

Lee Molloy amezungumza na BBC kutoka nyumbani kwake kwenye milima ya Colorado, Marekani ambapo wameruhusu bangi kwa ajili ya matumizi ya dawa tangu mwaka 2000 bangi na matumizi kwa ajili ya starehe tangu 2012. Huyu ndio aliyeasisi Kanisa hilo, akiwa na Steve Burke, na marafiki zake wengine kadhaa, wakilitumia Kanisa la zamani huko Denver, na kulibadili kuwa Kanisa la bangi. Lilikuwa jengo la zamani lenye miaka zaidi ya 110, na wamiliki wake walitaka kulifanya kuwa eneo la makazi, lakini waasisi hawa wakawashawishi wamiliki na kulitumia kwa ajili ya shughuli za umma. Katika miaka kadhaa iliyopita, imekuwa sehemu inayowavutia wageni wengi kufanya utalii. Serikali ya Marekani inalitambua kanisa hilo kama taasisi isiyojiendesha kifaida kama ilivyo kisheria kwa dini zingine nchini humo. Aprili 20 kila mwaka ni siku muhimu katika kalenda ya Kanisa hilo, ikiwa maalumu kwa ajili ya kusheherekea matumizi ya mmea huo na aina nyingine ya mimea kama hiyo yenye kuwekwa kwenye kundi la dawa ya kulevya. Pia namba 420 na Aprili 20 ni alama ya utamaduni wa bangi nchini Marekani, na inaaminika kwamba wanafunzi kadhaa wa Marekani wenye umri unaokadiriwa kufikia miaka 17 hukubaliana kukutana kila siku saa 10 na dakika 20 jioni kwenda kutafuta bangi. Wakati wa janga la corona, Kanisa hili la bangi liliweka masharti ya kujilinda na virusi kama walivyofanya makanisa mengine. Lee Molloy anasema kabla ya janga: ""Tunakusanyika, kunakuwa na muziki na mishumaa, tunawasha bangi, tunashirikiana pamoja, na tunasoma masomo ya matakatifu kutoka vyanzo tofauti tofauti."" Kuwa sehemu ya Kanisa hilo, hauhitaji kubadili dini yako ama  imani yakona wafuasi wa kanisa hilo wanajiita wokovu ama walokole, wameokoka. Lee Molloy  anafananisha kitendo hicho kama kupanda mlima ama hali ya kuwa juu kwenye uwanda wa juu. Anasema: ""Naishi milimani, ninapozidi kupanda mlima nahisi muinuko uliounganishwa na mazingira nilipo, lakini kuna muinuko wa kiroho, vile ulivyo kiroho.  Ni kama unavyosikia unavyovuta sigara. Kanisa la Kimataifa la Bangi sio la kwanza Marekani kutumia bangi kwenye imani ya kidini. Mwaka 2016 ilishuhudiwa kuanzishwa kwa makanisa mawili kama hayo, lakini hawafuati mafundisho anayosema Molloy kuhusu hisia za muinuko. Kulikuwa na kanisa lilililoitwa ""First Cannabis Church of Reason and Reason"" huko Michigan na baadaee likaanzishwa lingine ""First Cannabis Church"" huko Indiana. Mafundisho yaliyokuwa yanatolewa wakati huo ilikuwa ni 'mmea wa uponyaji (kwa maana ya bangi au marijuana) unatuleta pamoja na kutuunganisha na wengine, na ni chanzo cha afya zetu, mapenzi na dawa kwa magonjwa na msongo wa mawazo."" Sonia kutoka Lebanon (sio jina lake halisi) amekuwa akitumia bangi kwa miaka mingi, lakini havitiwi na wazo la yeye kujiunga ama kuwa sehemu ya Kanisa hilo la Kimataifa la bangi. Ameiambia BBC: ""Sijali kuhusu kujaribu kuwa sehemu ya Kanisa, lakini sioni kama ni mmea mtakatifu. Kwake bangi imekwa kama nyenzo ya kumsaidia kukabiliana na masahibu yanayomsumbua. ""tunapovuta bangi mkiwa kundi, usiogope kuzungumza kitu cha kijinga, kiwango chako cha kufikiri wakato huo kinakuwa kidogo na tunacheka tunafikiri tuna akili sana. Kwa Sonia haoni kama bangi ina kitu kingine zaidi. Moja ya malengo ya Kanisa la bangi ni kuondoa unyanyapaa wa kimaadili unaohusishwa na matumizi ya bangi. Tumemuuliza Lee Moloy huwa anawajibu nini wale ambao wanaona matumizi ya bangi kama kitu kibaya ""Mawazo haya mengi yanatoka kwa wato wasioelewa, lakini ni ngumu kuwamabia watu hivyo haitaonekana vyema, kwa hiyo nawakaribisha wafanye utafiti na kusoma. Wakubali mawazo haya kwamba kitu cha asili kinatupa zawadi,"" anasema.","'The national church of the bangi is a church like any other church, it has not been restructured here, but it is a bangi church and it is believed in sincerely,' said a representative of this church.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-52218936,"Makanisa makubwa makubwa nchini Nigeria sasa hayana watu na milango imefungwa huku kila mmoja akilazimika kufuata marufuku iliyowekwa na serikali ya kutokusanyika ili kuzuia kusambaa kwa virusi vya corona. Lakini hilo kufanyika, sio tu vitisho vimetolewa, lakini maafisa wametumia nguvu na watu kukamatwa katika maeneo mbalimbali nchini humo. Kwa baadhi ya visa maafisa wamelazimika kuchukua hatua moja kwa moja. ""Naomba kutumia maneno [Mtume] Mordechai: 'Kwa wakati kama huu tunachukua hatua ambazo ni sahihi, ""Amesema kiongozi wa vikosi vya usalama mjini Abuja wakati anamkamata kasisi mmoja mbele ya waumini wake. Kasisi huyo aliyekuwa amevalia nadhifu alionekana kuwa miongoni mwa watu mashuhuri ambao kwasasa wanaongoza waumini wengi katika taifa hilo la magharibi mwa Afrika. Makasisi siku hizi wamebadilisha Ukiristo nchini Nigeria kwa mahubiri yao, utabiri na ahadi zao za maiujiza. Mmoja wa wahubiri ambao ni mashuhuri ni TB Joshua, ambaye wiki iliyopita alidai kwamba ameoteshwa na Mungu na kutabiri kuwa janga la Corona litamalizika kufikia Machi 27, siku kadhaa kabla ya amri ya kukaa nyumbani kutangazwa katika mji wa Lagos, Ogun na mji mkuu wa Abuja. ""Kufikia mwisho wa mwezi huu, ama tunataka au la, haijalishi dawa ambayo watakuwa wameivumbua ugonjwa huu utatoweka kama ulivyoingia,"" alisema hivyo huku mkusanyiko wake ukimpigia makofi. Machi 27 ilipopita, mhubiri huyo ambaye huubiri katika televisheni alijipata akikejeliwa kwa utabiri wake wa uwongo. Lakini akajitetea na kwa mara nyengine tena akiwa mbele ya umati uliokuwa umekuja kuabudu, alisema: ""Nilicho maanisha ni kwamba ugonjwa huu utamalizikia pale ulipoanza katika mji wa Wuhan ambako tayari umedhibitiwa."" Wahubiri wengine wameshtumiwa kwa kupinga uwepo wa virusi hivyo mbele ya mamlaka na kusambaza taarifa za uwongo jambo ambalo ni kikwazo katika juhudi za kuzuia kusambaa kwa virusi vya corona. Utata mkubwa umesababishwa na mhubiri Chris Oyakhilome, ambaye katika video iliyosambaa mitandaoni, alihusisha virusi vya corona na teknolojia ya mawasiliano ya 5G na kudai kwamba ilikuwa sehemu ya njama ya kuunda amri mpya duniani. Maoni kama hayo yameshtumiwa vikali na wanasayansi ambao wanasema kuwa wazo la kuhusisha Covid-19 na teknolojia ya mtandao ya 5G ni upuuzi mtupu na kibaolojia ni jambo lisilowezekana kabisa. Kwa baadhi ya waumini wa Kikirsto, hasa wale ambao ni wa madhehebu ya makanisa ya Anglican na katoliki, juhudi zaidi zinahitajika kufanywa kupunguza ushawishi wa wahubiri ambao ni maarufu na watumia vibaya wafuasi wao. ""Wale ambao wanasema wana nguvu za kufanya miujiza, wenye mafuta ya upako na mambo kama hayo, huu ndio wakati wa kuthibitisha ambayo wamekuwa wakiambia wafuasi wao,"" amesema Bi. Blessing Ugonna kutoka Lagos. Lakini makanisa mengi, ambayo yamekuwa biashara yenye kuleta mamilioni ya pesa yamekubali mabadiliko yaliyojitokeza kwasababu ya Corona. Wanafanya maombi yao mitandaoni, huku familia zingine zikijaribu kutengeneza mazingira sawa na kanisani kwa kuva vizuri kila Jumapili kiasi hata cha kuokota sadaka kutoka kwa baadhi ya wanafamilia ili kuitoa kanisani. Makanisa pia yanatoa ufadhili kwa serikali na katika hatua ambayo kuna uwezekano mkubwa wakaendeleza umaarufu wao. Mhubiri Enoch Adeboye - mkuu wa kanisa la  Redeemed Christian Church of God ambalo lina matawi yake katika maeneo mengi ya miji ambayo ina waumini wengi wa Kikirsto pamoja na kusini mwa Nigeria - limechangia glovu 200,000, vitakasa mikono (hand sanitisers) 8,000, barakoa 8,000 kwa serikali ya mji wa Lagos. Na kanisa la Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention - linaloongozwa na Chukwuemeka Odumeje ambaye kuna wakati alisambaa kwenye mtandao wa kijamii wa Twitter kwa kuwapa watu chakula walio katika hatari ya kufa kwa njaa katika kipindi cha wiki mbili cha amri ya kusalia ndani. Aidha, waumini wengi wa Kikiristo bado wana hamu kubwa ya kwenda kanisani na hasa Jumapili iliyopita kwa sababu ilikuwa jumapili ya Matawi. Kawaida, mitaa ya Lagos huwa na watu wengi wanaotembea huku wakiwa wameshika matawi wakiigiza kuwasili kwa Yesu kabla ya kusulubiwa. Mitaa haikuwa na watu kabisa mwaka huu, na kuna uwezekano mkubwa hali ikaendelea kuwa hivyo kipindi cha msimu sikukuu ya pasaka. Lakini kuna kundi la watu wanne - wanawake 3 na mwanaume 1 wawaliokutana na mwandishi wa BBc wakirejea kutoka kwa misa ndogo iliyofanyika katika nyumba ya mmoja wao. Walipoulizwa kwanini wamepuuza ushauri wa kuomba kila mmoja peke yake nyumbani kwake, mmoja wao alisema: ""Hata bibilia inasema pale 2 au 3 wanapokusanyika, Mungu yuko pamoja nao. Bibilia haikusema mtu mmoja."" 'Mashujaa wa maombi' Kisha mwandishi wa BBC akaenda makao makuu ya kanisa la Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, ambalo linafahamika kwa maombi katika jimbo la Ogun. Walinzi walimuarifu kwamba hakuna huduma inayoendelea kwa sasa. ""Hakuna hata huduma ya mtandaoni?"" aliuliza. ""Hakuna hata huduma ya mtandaoni,"" mmoja wao, aliyekuwa amevaa fulana ya rangi ya chungwa, alimjibu. ""Kwahiyo wanaendeleza vipi Imani zao?"" Aliuliza. Mmoja wa walinzi akaingiza mkono ndani ya mkoba wake na kutoa kijitabu kidogo na kumkabidhi. ""Hicho ndicho wanachosema kipindi hiki cha amri ya kukaa ndani,"" alisema, kabla ya mlinzi kufunga mlango. Kijitabu hicho kimepewa jina la ''Thirty Days Prayer Retreat'' kwa kiingereza - kikinukuu baadhi ya aya katika bibilia.

The statement said the 'goal of Iran's actions was to cause chaos and sow discord within the United States and undermine public confidence in the US election'.

Watumiaji walioathirika ni pamoja na waandishi wa habari, wanaharakati wa haki za binadamu, wanasiasa wa upinzani na wanadiplomasia. NSO Group, kampuni ambayo hutengeneza programu za upelelezi, imekanusha madai hayo. Katika kesi iliyowasilishwa mahakamani, WhatsApp ilisema kuwa NSO Group ""ilitengeneza programu yake ya hila ili kufikia ujumbe na mawasiliano baada ya kuziunganisha  kwenye vifaa walivyolengwa"". Imesema kuwa  NSO Group  ilibuni akaunti kadhaa za WhatsApp  na kuwezesha  alama za siri  kuuunganishwa na hifadhi ya jumbe za WhatsApp  katika miezi ya Aprili  na Mei. ""Tunaamini shambulio   hili lililenga wajumbe 100 wa mashirika ya kiraia , jambo ambalo ni ukiukaji wa sheria,""  ilisema WhatsApp  katika taarifa yake. Watumiaji  walioathirika walikuwa na namba za siku kutoka nchi mbalimbali, mkiwemo  Bahrain, Muungano wa nchi za kiarabu na Mexico,  kulingana na mashtaka. WhatsApp imesema kuwa inataka marufuku ya kudumu dhidi ya  NSO itolewe na mahakama kutumia huduma zake. WhatsApp inajinadi kama programu  yenye mawasiliano "" yanayolindwa"" kwasababu jumbe zake huwa zimeunganishwa  baina ya watu wanaowasiliana pekee. Hii ikimaanisha kuwa mawasiliano huwa yanaweza  kuonekana baina ya kifaa, mfano simu ya mtumaji na mpokeaji. Kulingana na mwandishi wa habari wa BBC kitengo cha digitali, Basillioh Mutahi, udukuzi na upelelezi wa data katika  mitandao ya kijamii umeongezeka katika miaka ya hivi karibuni. Mutahi anasema mtumiaji wa Whatsap na mitandao mingine ya kijamii anaweza kuepuka udukuzi wa mawasiliano yake kwa  kuepuka kubofya au kubonyeza   katika kila ujumbe unaotumwa  au kusambazwa kwake, hususan pale unapokuwa na chanzo ambacho mtumiaji hakifahamu. ''Mara nyingi utapata unatumia ujumbe ambao unasema bonyeza hapa utapata data au bando za bure, au unatumiwa kiunganishi (link) kinachokupeleka kwenye ukurasa mwingine, unapaswa kuwa makini na ujumbe wa aina hii kwasababu unapopelekwa kwenye ukurasa mwingine inawezekana data za simu yako au kompyuta yako zinachukuliwa na mtu mwingine ambaye anaweza kuzitumia kuingilia mawasiliano yako'' anasema Mutahi. Mutahi anasema njia nyingine ya kuepukana na udukuzi wa taarifa zako mtandaoni  ni kuhakikisha unapokuwa na tarakimu mbili za siri  (log in) za kuingia kwenye kurasa zako za mtandao,  mtu anaweza kujiwekea mwenyewe kwenye kifaa chake cha mawasiliano. Unapoweka mpango huu,  mfano mtu anaweza kutaka kuingia kwenye mtandao wako kwa kutumia tarakimu yako ya siri (password), lakini kama umeweka mpango wako wa password mbili itakua ni vigumu kwani mpango wa pili utatuma tarakimu za siri kwenye simu yako ya mkononi  kwa hiyo itakuwa ni vigumu kwa mdukuzi kuingia kwenye akaunti yako, anasema Mutahi. Bwana Mutahi ambaye  ni mwandishi wa taarifa za  Kidigitali kwa muda mrefu anasema maeneo ya  huduma za data za  WiFi zinazotolewa bure kwa umma pia si salama kwa taarifa ama data za kibinafsi  kwani mtoaji huduma hiyo huenda anatazama taarifa za watu walioingia kwenye mitandao. Matumizi ya  kompyuta zinazotumiwa na kampuni au na watu wengi kwa pamoja pia si salama anasema Mutahi, na kuongeza kuwa mtu mwingine anaweza kuingia katika akaunti yako ya WhatsApp  kupitia kompyuta unayoitumia kupitia desktop. ''Kuna njia mtu anaweza kutumia kuingia kwa WhatsApp kupitia desktop''. Anasisitiza Mtu anakutumia link inayokulazimu kubadili na wanakwambia imeexpire na kubadili password na unabadilisha  na unakosa akaunti yako...Nilibadilisha nikapata sina link ya kupata.","'Facebook's company does not own the WhatsApp account that communicated with the Israeli NSO Group, as this company engaged in and collaborated with spyware development for users of this account in billions. 1.5 billion WhatsApp accounts were handed over to this company in exchange for the program, with 1,400 backdoors installed to facilitate the penetration.

Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, kutoka Quebec, Canada, amekiri hatia katika mahakama ya Florida. Msichana huyo mwenye umri wa miaka 34 alikuwa mwanachama wa kikosi cha NetWalker ransomware, ambacho kimeshambulia makampuni ya Marekani, manispaa, hospitali, shule na vyuo vikuu. Alipokamatwa, polisi waligundua alikuwa na $27m (£22.2m) katika Bitcoin. Kesi hiyo inawakilisha mfano adimu wa kukamatwa kwa mafanikio na kufunguliwa mashtaka kwa mdukuzi anayefanya kazi katika kundi la uhalifu wa mtandaoni lenye makao yake nchini Urusi. Nyaraka za mahakama ya Marekani zinasema kwamba raia huyo wa Kanada, ambaye alijulikana kwa jina la Sebastien Vachon, alikuwa mmoja wa washirika wa NetWalker waliokuwa na ufanisi zaidi. Ushahidi uliokusanywa na polisi unaonyesha kwamba alianza uvamizi kati ya Aprili na Desemba 2020, na kushambulia kampuni 17 za Canada na zingine nyingi ulimwenguni. NetWalker iliendesha biashara ya jinai ya ukombozi-kama-huduma, ikitoa programu yake mbovu na tovuti ya ulaghai kwa washirika wa wadukuzi. Viongozi hao huwasiliana kwa Kirusi mtandaoni na kuhakikisha kwamba programu zao hasidi hazivurugi mifumo ya kompyuta ya Urusi au zile za nchi za zamani za Sovieti ambazo sasa ni wanachama wa Jumuiya ya Madola. Washirika kama Bw Vachon-Desjardins wana jukumu la kutambua na kushambulia waathiriwa wa thamani ya juu kwa kutumia programu ya ukombozi. Baada ya mwathiriwa kulipa, wasanidi programu na washirika hugawanya fidia au sehemu ya pesa kutokana na kuuza data ya kibinafsi mtandaoni ikiwa mwathiriwa atakataa kulipa. Bw. Vachon-Desjardins alikamatwa nchini Canada Januari 2021 na baadaye kurejeshwa nchini kufuatia uchunguzi wa Marekani kuhusu kundi la uhalifu wa mtandaoni, ambalo lilisambaratisha operesheni yake ya mtandaoni na kufichua hifadhidata ya maelezo ya washirika. Ilifichua kuwa kundi la NetWalker lilikuwa na takriban wanachama 100, wakiwemo washirika, ambao walichukua angalau $40m kutoka kwa wahasiriwa. Katika tukio moja, kundi hilo lilinyakua $1.14m kutoka chuo kikuu cha Marekani kujaribu kutengeneza chanjo ya Covid-19. Shambulio la NetWalker kwenye Kliniki ya Chuo Kikuu cha Düsseldorf mnamo Septemba 2020 pia inaaminika kuchangia kifo cha mgonjwa ambaye alilazimika kuhamishwa hadi hospitali nyingine kwa matibabu. Katika kila tukio waathiriwa wangepata barua kwenye kompyuta zao ikisomeka: ""Hujambo! Faili zako zimesimbwa kwa njia fiche na NetWalker. ""Algoriti zetu za usimbaji fiche ni kali sana na faili zako zinalindwa vyema sana, njia pekee ya kurejesha faili zako ni kushirikiana nasi na kupata programu ya kusimbua. Kwetu sisi hii ni biashara tu.""

In one instance, this network made $1.14m from a Canadian city attempting to create a coronavirus vaccine.

The leader was in contact with foreign entities and was believed to be using computers from former Soviet countries that are now part of the Russian state. The hackers had the task of identifying and attacking high-value targets using cyber-attack programs. After the trial, they deleted the program and hackers sought ransom or funds related to data theft if the defendant did not leave. Bw. Vachon-Desjardins was sentenced in Canada in January 2021 and later extradited to the United States for cybercrime investigations related to the global ransomware network, which involved disrupting the operations and collecting data from hackers. It is believed that the NetWalker network had about 100 hackers, including individuals, who earned around $40m from the attacks. In one instance, this network made $1.14m from a Canadian city attempting to create a coronavirus vaccine. The NetWalker attack on the Düsseldorf Public Health Clinic in September 2020 also involved a ransom note stating, ""Hello! Your files are encrypted with NetWalker. Our encryption algorithms are very strong, and your files are likely lost, the only way to restore them is to contact us."" The police seized 719 Bitcoins worth approximately C$35m","

Wiki sita zimepita, ambapo tumekuwa tukifuatilia matukio ya Qatar, ambapo Wales iliangukia kwenye hatua ya makundi na Uingereza ikakumbana na msiba wa penalti tena, kabla ya Argentina kunyanyua Kombe la Dunia la 2022. Tarehe 26 Desemba ligi kuu ya Uingereza inarejea, na iwapo tu ulikuwa umesahau jinsi tulivyoiacha, BBC Sport itakuletea kwa hatua hali tulivyoacha na ilivyo sasa . Arsenal wako mbele baada ya mechi 14 za kwanza za kampeni. Wamejikusanyia pointi 37, na kuwaacha katika mechi mbili pekee hadi sasa - kichapo chao pekee ni dhidi ya  Manchester United mapema Septemba. Baada ya kuanza vyema Ligi ya Premia, hii ni mara ya kwanza watakuwa kileleni wakati wa Krismasi tangu msimu wa 2007-08. Timu zote saba zilizoshinda michezo 12 kati ya 14 za kwanza zimeshinda taji la Ligi Kuu. Ishara nyingine nzuri kwa The Gunners ni timu iliyoongoza jedwali siku ya Krismasi imekuwa mabingwa katika misimu 10 kati ya 13 iliyopita. Katika mchezo wao wa kwanza nyuma watamenyana na West Ham kwenye Uwanja wa Emirates. Huku Manchester City inayoshika nafasi ya pili ikiwa haijacheza hadi Disemba 28 - huko Leeds - ushindi utaifanya The Gunners kuwa pointi nane mbele ya mabingwa. Newcastle - wapinzani wa kushtukiza katika mwisho wa jedwali - watakuwa Leicester mnamo Disemba 26 na watataka kuendelea na pale walipoishia. Ushindi wa sita mfululizo utawasogeza juu ya Manchester City na kuwa ya pili. Kuna timu chache katika nusu ya juu ambazo labda zimekuwa na muda wa kujiangalia wakati wa Kombe la Dunia kabla ya kurudi tena. Tottenham iliifunga Leeds kabla ya mapumziko, lakini ilikuwa imepoteza tatu kati ya nne za awali. Wanafungua safu  Jumatatu kwa mechi ya ugenini huko Brentford (12:30 GMT). Chelsea ya Graham Potter haijashinda katika mechi tano za Ligi Kuu ya Uingereza na walitumia mapumziko ya Kombe la Dunia katika mechi ya nane. Kwa ushahidi wa mechi 14 au zaidi za kwanza, vita vya kuteremka daraja msimu huu vinaweza kuwa wazi. Alama tisa pekee zinatenganisha timu 12 za chini kwenye kitengo, huku Wolves wakiinua kila mtu. Ni timu sita pekee ambazo zimewahi kuwa mkiani wakati wa Krismasi na kusalia juu - huku nusu ya hizo zikiwa katika kampeni tatu za kwanza za Ligi Kuu - lakini Wanderers watakuwa wanatafuta kukabiliana na mtindo huo na mtu mpya kwenye usukani. Julen Lopetegui alichukua usukani tarehe 14 Novemba na tayari analenga maboresho makubwa, ikiwa ni pamoja na katika kikosi chake, huku Mhispania huyo akitaka kusajiliwa kwa wachezaji sita wakati dirisha la uhamisho litakapofunguliwa tarehe 1 Januari. Southampton pia walifanya mabadiliko ya usimamizi muda mfupi kabla ya mapumziko, huku Nathan Jones akiwasili kutoka Luton kuchukua nafasi ya Ralph Hasenhuttl aliyetimuliwa huko St Mary's. The Saints wamepoteza michezo yao mitatu iliyopita na wako nafasi ya 19, pointi mbili kutoka kwa usalama. Labda inashangaza kuona hakuna vilabu vingine vinavyochagua kufanya mabadiliko, huku Kombe la Dunia likitoa kwa ufanisi kipindi kidogo cha kabla ya msimu wa katikati wa kampeni. Everton wamekwama na meneja Frank Lampard licha ya kukaa nafasi ya 17 nyuma ya vichapo viwili mfululizo, na David Moyes anasalia kuwa kocha wa West Ham ingawa wamepoteza watatu kwenye jedwali na kukaa pointi moja tu juu ya tatu za mwisho.  Kombe  kali la Dunia, la katikati ya msimu daima lilibeba hatari ya uchovu na majeraha kwa wachezaji. Viongozi Arsenal huenda wakaathirika zaidi kutokana na jeraha baya la goti lililompata mshambuliaji wa Brazil Gabriel Jesus. Inaweza kuwa mwishoni mwa Februari kabla hatujamuona tena uwanjani baada ya mwanzo mzuri wa wakati wake akiwa na The Gunners, ingawa moja ambayo ilimfanya kushindwa kufunga katika mechi sita za ligi kabla ya mapumziko. Kinyume chake, licha ya kuwa na wachezaji wengi kuliko klabu yoyote kwenye Kombe la Dunia wakiwa na wachezaji 16, Manchester City kwa sasa hawana majeruhi wa kuripoti. Wengi wa wawakilishi wao nchini Qatar walitoka katika mchuano hadi nusu fainali, na Julian Alvarez wa Argentina pekee ndiye aliyefanikiwa kupita nane bora. Kwa kuongezea, mfungaji bora wa Premier League Erling Haaland ameweza kupumzika kwa wiki tano, tayari kurejea na kujaribu kuongeza idadi yake ya mabao 18 katika michezo 13. Mshambulizi huyo wa Norway aliichezea City mechi yake ya kwanza tangu Novemba ilipofungwa na Brentford katika ushindi wa 2-0 wa kirafiki dhidi ya Girona mnamo Disemba 17, na kufunga, kama alivyofanya Mbelgiji Kevin de Bruyne. Nia ya dhati italipwa kwa ni wachezaji gani ambao walijeruhiwa kabla ya Kombe la Dunia watakuwa tayari kwa hatua tena. Wachezaji kama Reece James na Wesley Fofana huko Chelsea, mshambuliaji wa Newcastle Alexander Isak na Dominic Calvert-Lewin wa Everton wote wanaweza kurejea, ingawa mshambuliaji wa Liverpool Luis Diaz amefanyiwa upasuaji wa goti na anakabiliwa na miezi mitatu zaidi nje.  Ili kujumuisha Kombe la Dunia katika msimu wa ndani, mechi sasa zitachezwa mara kwa mara ili mechi zote ziweze kutimizwa kwa wakati ufaao. Kati ya sasa na mwisho wa Januari kuna raundi tano za mechi za ligi kuu za Uingereza. Haya yote yanajiri baada ya vilabu vingine kushiriki Kombe la Carabao raundi ya nne, huku michezo hiyo ikifanyika Disemba 20-22.

The final match of the season was played on Sunday, 13 November, with Manchester United losing to Fulham in a match that saw six goals scored, including a penalty shootout that saw Wales join England in the penalty shoot-out, before Argentina won the 2022 World Cup. On December 26, the English league season resumed, and if everything went as planned, BBC Sport reported that the matches would be played live and continue to be so. Arsenal were first to play after the 14 initial Premier League matches. They earned 37 points, and have been in the top two since then - the only team to have played more than 12 of the first 14 matches is Manchester United, who played their first game in the Christmas period since 2007-08. All seven teams played 12 to 14 early fixtures, with the exception of Manchester City, who played their first match in the Christmas period on December 28 - they faced Leeds, who had not played since October 28. Newcastle, who were the last to play in the fixture list, were facing Leicester on December 26 and were eager to get back on track. The six-match win streak put Manchester City above Newcastle and second.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-59578065,"Katika kitabu chake mashuhuri cha Sapiens, mwanahistoria Yuval Noah Harari, anaeleza kuhusu kwanini binadamu amepiga hatua kubwa kimaendeleo kulinganisha na wanyama wengine. Sababu anazotoa ni mbili tu; uwezo wa kushirikiana kufanya kazi kwa idadi kubwa na kwa maelewano na pili uwezo wa kuumba kitu ambacho huenda hakishikiki wala kuonekana lakini kinaaminika. Nchi ya Tanzania ni mojawapo ya 'uumbaji' uliofanywa na mwanadamu. Miaka 100 iliyopita, eneo ambalo leo nchi hiyo ipo lilikuwepo lakini jina hilo halikuwepo. Wakati Watanzania wakijiandaa kutimiza miaka 60 ya Uhuru wa Tanganyika Desemba 9 mwaka huu -ni wakati mzuri sasa kutazama ni mambo ambayo yameifanya Tanzania kuwa hivi ilivyo leo. Kwa wanasayansi, Tanzania ni mojawapo ya maeneo ambako inatajwa wanadamu walianza kuishi kuliko mahali pengine duniani. Katika utafiti uliofanywa na Mary Leakey katika eneo la Laetoli, mkoani Arusha, kuna ushahidi kuwa watu wa zama za kale waliojulikana kwa jina la Australopithecus afarensis waliishi hapo zaidi ya miaka milioni 3 iliyopita. Msafiri wa Kiarabu, Ibn Battuta, aliandika katika maandishi yake ya karne ya 14 kuhusu mji wa Kilwa ulioko Lindi ambako aliueleza kama mojawapo ya miji mizuri zaidi aliyowahi kuiona katika safari zake duniani kote. Hata mwanafalsafa wa Kiyunani, Ptolemy, katika kitabu chake cha Jiografia, ameeleza kwa kina kuhusu mji aliouita Raphta ulioko katika eneo la Azania akieleza ulikuwa na sifa zote za kuwa mji. Haijajulikana kwa yakini ni mji upi hasa alikuwa anauzungumza lakini wapo wataalamu wa mambokale wanaodhani huo ni mji uliokuwa katika eneo la Delta ya Rufiji. Kilwa, Laetoli, Zanzibar, Unyanyembe na maeneo mengine ambayo sasa ni sehemu ya Tanzania yalikuwapo kabla ya mwaka 1964 na kabla ya mwaka 1920 lakini hiki kitu ambacho sasa kinajulikana kama Tanzania hakikuwepo. Watanzania na Utanzania wao. Upole wao kwa wanadamu wengine na ukali wao dhidi ya maovu. Amani na utulivu wao, silka na tabia zao, lugha yao na vitu vingine kadhaa vimekuja kutambulika katika kipindi cha miaka 60 iliyopita. Tanzania ni muungano wa nchi mbili; Tanganyika na Zanzibar. Nchi hizi mbili ziliungana rasmi mnamo Aprili 26, mwaka 1964 na kutengeneza jina hilo moja. Historia inamtaja Mzee Mohamed Ikbar Dar - wakati huo akiwa mwanafunzi wa sekondari kama mtu aliyetunga jina hilo. Alichofanya ni kuchukua herufi tatu za mwanzo za majina ya nchi zilizoungana - Tan na Zan, na kisha; kwa maneno yake mwenyewe, kuongeza herufi mbili za IA ambacho ni ufupisho wa jina lake la kwanza na la dini yake ya Ahmaddiya. Ilisadifu pia, wakati huo, kwamba ilikuwa ni kama fasheni kwa nchi huru za Afrika kuwa na herufu hizo mbili za IA kwenye majina yake. Mfano ni nchi kama Somalia, Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria na Ethiopia. Hilo ndilo jina lililopitishwa na kukubaliwa na leo nchi inajulikana hivyo na watu wake wakiitwa Tanzania. Isingekuwa ubunifu huo wa Ikbar, pengine nchi hii ingekuwa sasa inajulikana kwa jina lingine - watu wengi walikuwa wakitarajia pengine nchi ingeitwa Azania. Jina la Tanganyika ni mchanganyiko wa majina mawili pia; Tanga - ikimaanisha kutembea au kuzunguka (kutangatanga) na nyika ambao ni uwanda wa pori. Zanzibar yenyewe imetokana na neon Zenj - ikimaanisha watu weusi ambao ndiyo walikuwa wenyeji waliokutwa na wageni kutoka ng'ambo waliokwenda kutembelea visiwa hivyo. Pasipo Muungano wa Tanganyika na Zanzibar, kusingekuwa na nchi inaitwa Tanzania leo. Wakati Muungano huo ukitokea, dunia ilikuwa katika wimbi la Vita Baridi na Zanzibar ikitazamwa kwa jicho la kipekee kama nchi inayoweza kugeuka kuwa 'Cuba' ya Afrika. Vitabu na maandishi kadhaa vilivyowahi kuandikwa kuhusu Muungano vinaeleza kuwa Rais wa Kwanza wa Zanzibar, Abeid Amani Karume, alikubali Muungano kwa sababu pia alitaka kuwa na swahiba wa kisiasa - nchi, kumsaidia kupambana na aliowahisi kuwa washindani wake wa kisiasa katika siku za awali za utawala wake. Mambo mengi ni ya kufikirika zaidi lakini pasipo Muungano, huenda siasa za Zanzibar zisingekuwa zilivyo sasa na kama siasa za visiwani zingebadilika, ni wazi kwamba na siasa za Tanganyika zisingebaki kama zilivyo. Pasi na shaka yoyote, Tanzania ya leo ingekuwa tofauti na ambayo ingetokea. Kama hatimaye mahasimu wa kisiasa wa Karume wangefanikiwa kumtoa madarakani - na kwa namna walivyokuwa na mtazamo wa kimajumui, ni wazi Tanganyika ndiyo ingekuwa lengo lao la pili. Pasi na shaka yoyote, historia ya Tanzania ya leo isingekuwa hii ilivyo sasa. Miongoni mwa nguzo muhimu za amani na utulivu wa Tanzania ni Jeshi la Ulinzi la Wananchi wa Tanzania (JWTZ). Katika mojawapo ya siku za giza kabisa kwenye historia ya taifa hilo ilikuwa ni Januari mwaka 1964 wakati baadhi ya askari walipotaka kuasi. Kama jaribio lile lingefanikiwa, huenda historia ya Tanzania ingekuwa tofauti. Jaribio lile lilizimwa na ndilo lililomfanya aliyekuwa Rais wa Tanganyika wakati ule, Julius Nyerere, kuamua kulivunja lililokuwa Jeshi la KAR na kuunda JWTZ. Kwa namna lilivyosukwa na kujengewa itikadi, jeshi hilo liliiepusha Tanzania na rabsha za wanajeshi ambazo zilikuwa jambo la kawaida katika nchi nyingi za Kiafrika. Kwamba Tanzania imekuwa mojawapo ya mataifa machache ambayo hayajawahi kushuhudia mapinduzi ya kijeshi ni mojawapo ya mafanikio makubwa ya kuundwa kwa JWTZ lakini kutokana na kushindwa kwa uasi wa wanajeshi wa mwaka 1964. Tanzania ni mojawapo ya mataifa machache ya Kiafrika ambayo yanaunganishwa na lugha moja isiyo ya kigeni. Hii ndiyo imekuwa lugha isiyo na kabila, dini, ukanda wala kipato. Watanzania, karibu wa makundi yote, wanazungumza lugha moja ya Kiswahili. Lugha hii ambayo ina ushawishi mkubwa wa lugha za kibantu na kiarabu, ina tabia zake ambazo zina utu, uungwana na upendo. Ndiyo sababu, kumekuwa na utani katika baadhi ya nchi jirani na Tanzania kwamba raia wake ni watu ""wanaoomba"" hata kwa vitu ambavyo wanavinunua kwa fedha zao. Lugha hii moja imesaidia sana kuunganisha nchi ambayo ina makabila zaidi ya 120 yenye mila, desturi na tamaduni zake tofauti. Kama isingekuwa jitihada za makusudi za kukifanya Kiswahili kiwe Lugha ya Taifa, huenda leo kungekuwa na matatizo mengine ambayo yanazikuta nchi nyingine. Mathalani, ukabila hautajwi kuwa tatizo nchini Tanzania, asili yake inaweza kuwa inatokana na watu wote kuweza kuwasiliana kwa kutumia lugha moja ambayo inaonekana kuwa ni ya wote, ingawa wenyeji watasema ni ya watu wa pwani. Kwa namna moja au nyingine, kama kuna mtu mmoja anaweza kusema ana mkono muhimu zaidi katika uumbaji wa Tanzania, basi mtu huyo ni Baba wa Taifa, Julius Nyerere. Kuliko mtu mwingine yeyote au taasisi nyingine yoyote, amehusika katika kuifanya Tanzania iwe ilivyo leo. Tofauti na Ulaya au Asia ambako nchi zilijengwa kwa misingi ya kujikinga na vita au kwenda vitani, nchi za Afrika ziliundwa kutokana na mapatano ya mkutano wa Berlin wa Novemba 1884 hadi Februari 1885. Hata nchi yenyewe ya Tanganyika iliundwa na Jumuiya ya Mataifa (League of Nations) baada ya Vita vya Kwanza vya Dunia wakati taifa hilo lilipogawiwa kwa Uingereza kutoka kwa Ujerumani. Kwa hiyo, wakati Nyerere anakabidhiwa nchi na Waingereza mwaka 1961, hakuwa na hofu ya kuingiliwa kwenye mipaka yake wala kwenda kuvamia nchi nyingine kwa sababu jambo hilo tayari lilishakatazwa kwenye sheria za kimataifa. Yeye ndiye alijenga mfumo wa kisiasa unaowapa viongozi mamlaka kuliko raia wao. Pengine, mfumo huu ndiyo ambao umesababisha aina ya siasa zilizoko Tanzania ambako wananchi - kwa muda mrefu, ni kama hawakuwa na habari sana na masuala ya uwajibikaji wa viongozi wao. Yeye ndiye aliyeunda JWTZ na Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) - taasisi mbili ambazo zimekuwa na ushawishi mkubwa katika siasa za Tanzania. Ni yeye pia aliyekuwa mchagizaji mkuu wa matumizi ya lugha ya Kiswahili na mwendeshaji wa siasa ya nje ya taifa lake. Zaidi ya asilimia 70 ya Watanzania hawajawahi kuona chama kingine cha sasa kikiwa madarakani mbali na CCM katika uhai wao. Hiki ndicho chama ambacho kwa takribani miaka 50 kimeongoza nchi kwa kutumia sera na miongozo. Kwa sababu hiyo, kiwango cha kuendelea (kutoendelea), kilichopo Tanzania sasa, kina uhusiano wa moja kwa moja na chama ambacho kimekuwa madarakani kwa muda wote wa uhai wa taifa hili. CCM ndiyo imetoa mwongozo wa nchi kwenye maeneo kama elimu, afya, miundombinu, uchumi, siasa na masuala mengine muhimu kwa taifa. Pasi na shaka yoyote, kama chama cha Zuberi Mtemvu ndiyo kingeingia madarakani baada ya Uhuru na siasa zake za ""Afrika kwa Waafrika"" pengine Tanzania ingekuwa tofauti na ilivyo sasa. Barani Afrika, kuna nchi chache zinaweza kusema kwamba zina chama kimoja cha siasa chenye ushawishi wa aina ambayo CCM imekuwa nayo kwa Tanzania na Watanzania kwa ujumla. Taifa lolote hujengwa kwa matukio ambayo huibua mashujaa watakaozungumzwa vizazi na vizazi. Katika miaka yake 60, Tanzania ilipigana katika vita moja dhidi ya Uganda ambapo iliibuka mshindi kwa kuondoa madarakani utawala wa Nduli Idi Amini Dada. Julius Nyerere akaweka rekodi ya kuwa Amiri Jeshi Mkuu pekee aliyeipeleka Tanzania vitani na kuibuka mshindi - lakini tukio hilo likitengeneza historia ya kudumu ya watu kama Jenerali Abdallah Twalipo, Jenerali David Musuguri, Jenerali Ernest Mwita Kiaro, Luten Jenerali Silas Mayunga, (Mti Mkavu), Luteni Jenerali Tumaini Kiwelu, Brigedia John Butler Warden, Brigedia Benjamin Msuya na wengine wengi walioshiriki vita hiyo. Jambo kubwa kuhusu vita ile ni kwamba Watanzania - sasa wakiwa nchi huru, waliungana kwa pamoja vitani na kukubali kuifia nchi yao kwa sababu ya bendera yao na si ya mkoloni. Matukio ya kukusanya watu, kuchangia mali na damu, kusafirisha watu na nyimbo za kimapinduzi zilizoimbwa na wasanii mbalimbali zilisaidia sana katika kujenga Tanzania ya wakati ule na msingi wake ungalipo hadi leo. Ukitaka kujua vilabu hivi viwili vya mchezo wa soka vina maana gani kwa Tanzania, inabidi nitoe mfano mmoja ninaoujua. Mmoja wa marais wastaafu wa Tanzania alipata kuniambia kwamba hakuna namna ambayo tarehe ya Uchaguzi Mkuu wa Tanzania inaweza kupangwa katika siku ambayo kuna pambano la Watani wa Jadi. Inajulikana kwamba wakati Simba na Yanga zinapocheza, Tanzania karibu yote husimama. Kuliko chama cha siasa au dini nyingine yoyote, hakuna taasisi inayoweza kujidai kuwa na ufuasi ambao vilabu hivi vinao. Vilabu hivi vinakusanya masikini na matajiri, vijana na wazee, wanawake na wanaume, watu wa rangi, dini na makabila yote wanashabikia timu hizi. Timu hizi mbili zimeshiriki katika kujenga umoja na amani miongoni mwa Watanzania. Kwenye kushabikia timu hizi mbili, hakuna ubaguzi au tofauti ya aina yoyote na wala hakuna klabu mojawapo ya hizo inayoweza kufungamanishwa na dini, dhehebu au chama chochote cha siasa. Misri wanajivunia vilabu vya Al Ahly na Zamalek lakini kuna itikadi za kidini au siasa ambazo unaweza kuziunganisha na vilabu hivyo viwili - jambo ambalo ni tofauti na Simba na Yanga ambazo ziko kwenye miji yote, dini zote, vyama vyote na miongoni mwa watu wa rangi zote. Kwa hiyo, Rais mstaafu, Jakaya Kikwete na Mwenyekiti wa Chadema, Freeman Mbowe wanaweza kuwa na itikadi tofauti kisiasa lakini kwenye Yanga wanakuwa kitu kimoja. Inawezekana Kiongozi wa ACT Wazalendo, Zitto Kabwe, na Waziri Mkuu, Kassim Majaliwa, wanapishana kisiasa lakini linapokuja suala la Simba, wanakuwa kitu kimoja. Si sawa na Kenya ambako Gor Mahia inahusishwa moja kwa moja na watu wa kabila la Wajaluo au AFC Leopards na kabila la Waluhya. Taasisi hizi mbili - ni miongoni mwa nguzo kubwa ya ndoto ile inayoitwa Tanzania. Watu na matukio niliyoyataja, yamesaidia sana katika kutengeneza taifa la Tanzania kwa namna linavyoonekana sasa kwa ndani na nje ya mipaka yake. Hata hivyo, ujenzi wa taifa ni suala endelevu na pasi na shaka yoyote bado kuna sura (chapters) nyingine bado hazijafikiwa wakati wake au kusomwa kupitia makala hii. Hata hivyo, katika kipindi hiki cha miaka 60 iliyopita, unaweza kusema kwamba pamoja na mapungufu mengine yaliyopo katika nyanja kama vile uchumi, haki za kiraia, afya, elimu na kwingineko, angalau waasisi wamefanikiwa kujenga utaifa wa Tanzania ingawa kazi hiyo bado haijakamilika.",kwa kawaida kwa jina la Tanzania.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-43084886,"Mwanamume aliyejibadilisha jinsia na kuwa mwanamke amefanikiwa kumyonyesha mtoto katika kisa cha kwanza cha aina yake kuwahi kushuhudiwa, watafiti wanasema. Mwanaume huyo ambaye sasa ni mwanamke mwenye umri wa miaka 30 alitaka kumnyonyesha mtoto baada ya mpenzi wake aliyejifungua kusema hataki kumnyonyesha mtoto huyo, hayo ni kwa mujibu wa jarida la afya la watu waliojibadili jinsia. Alifanikiwa kunyonyesha baada ya kumeza dawa na kukamua maziwa, ripoti hiyo inasema kutoka nchini Marekani. Mtaalamu wa Marekani anasema utafiti huo huenda ukachangia visa zaidi vya wanaume kujibadilisha jinsia na kuwa wanawake kunyonyesha watoto. Mwanamke huyo aliyekuwa anapokea matibabu ya kubadili homoni zake mwilini kwa muda wa miaka 6, lakini hajafanyiwa upasuaji kubadili sehemu zake za siri, wakati alipowaomba madaktari wamsaidie atimize lengo lake la kumnyonyesha mtoto. Kabla ya mtoto huyo kuzaliwa, madakatari walimpa dawa za miezi mitatu unusu kumsaidia kupata maziwa, kwa kawaida dawa hizo hupewa wanawake waliowaasili watoto au waliojipatia watoto kupitia wanawake wanaobeba mimba kibiashara kuwaisaidia wasioweza kuzaa. Dawa hizo husisimua homoni mwilini kushinikiza kutoa maziwa na kuzuia homoni za kiume na pia alihitajika kukamua maziwa yake. Na matokeo yake, yalimsababisha mwanamke huyo kuweza kupata maziwa kiasi. Watafiti wanasema mtoto huyo alikunywa maziwa hayo tuu kwa wiki zake sita za uhai, wakati ambapo ukuwaji wake, ulaji na uwendaji haja wake ulikuwa unaendelea kama kawaida. Baada ya hapa, mtoto alianza kupewa maziwa ya mkebe kwasababu maziwa yalianza kupungua. Dkt Channa Jayasena, mhadhiri mkuu katika chuo cha Imperial College anayejishughulisha na masuala ya uzazi amesema, utafiti huo ni 'hatua nzuri'. Amesema ameshasikia visa kadhaa nchini Uingereza vya wanaume waliogeuka kuwa wanawake wanasaidiwa kunyonyesha, lakini mpaka sasa hakuna ripoti iliyochapishwa. Amesema:""Tunachohiaji kufanya nikuvikusanya visa hivi na tusaidiane kimawazo, tutafute mbinu muafaka kuwasaidia kunyonyesha bila ya kuwadhuru ki afya."" Watafiti wanasema haijabainika wazi iwapo dawa zote zinazotumika zinahitajika kufanikisha wazazi hao kuwawezesha kunyonyesha. Wamesema uchunguzi zaidi unahitajika kubaini matibabu halisi ya wanaume wanaojibadili jinsia kuwa wanawake wanaotaka kunyonyesha.","'A man who underwent gender transition and became a woman was successfully giving birth to a child in her first attempt, according to the first case reported in a medical journal. Those who are now women, aged 30, wish to give birth after their husbands stop talking to them until they give birth, as stated in a newspaper article. An American professor said this situation could lead to more visa applications from people who want to transition gender and become women to give birth. This woman was referred for gender reassignment surgery at the age of 6, but was not successful in changing her secondary sexual characteristics, until a doctor noticed her ability to lactate. Before this child was born, doctors gave her three months' worth of pills to stimulate lactation, usually these pills are given to women who have lost their ability to breastfeed or to women who are unable to breastfeed due to medical conditions. These pills helped her breast size. With this, she is able to produce enough milk for her child. The report states that this child was breastfed with that milk for six months, during which time her health, weight, and condition were good. After this, the child began to breastfeed directly from the mother's breast as the milk flowed.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/articles/c72n4jjvl1eo,"Siku zina kasi.Na hazina huruma  iwapo ndimi za viongozi wa kisiasa zinatoa cheche na ahadi na kusikika kama  wimbo mtamu katika masikio ya wapiga kura na wananchi kwa jumla . Kwa rais wa Kenya William Ruto  siku zake 100  akiwa usukani kuiongoza nchi hiyo zimetimia leo tarehe 22 Disemba 2022. Katikati ya  harakati za kampeni alitoa ahadi nyingi mno ambazo kwa wafuasi wake zilipokelewa kama mwanzo wa matumaini ya kurahisisha hali zao. Hata hivyo sio rahisi kukadiria mafanikio  ya utawala wake katika siku 100 bila  kuzingatia mambo kadhaa. Kuna tofauti ya mcheza densi na mpiga gita-mmoja ana utaalamu wa kusuka sauti za nyaya za gita kutoa mlio wa kuvutia kuwa muziki. Mwingine hana kubwa ila kusikia mlio huo mtamu na kuuainisha na densi ya maungo ya mwili wake kuunda densi.Ndio hali inayoeleza kinachofanyika sasa kuhusiana  na matumaini ya wengi wakati wa kampeni na hali halisi wakati huu ambapo Ruto amekuwa  uongozini  kwa zaidi ya miezi mitatu . Awali ahadi zake zilikuwa rahisi kuzitoa na zilisikika kama wimbo kwa wafuasi wake.Lakini sasa ,kibarua kimebadilika baada ya muziki kukoma na kazi ngumu ya kutekeleza ahadi hizo kuanza . Kwa ahadi nyingi alizotoa rais na muungano wake wa Kenya Kwanza ,amepondwa na uhalisia wa mambo baada ya kuchukua usukani . Kuna  ahadi kadhaa alizofaulu kuzitimiza na nyingine  huenda amezifanya hadi kufikia katikati  lakini kwa wengi,makubwa bado hayajatimizwa ama  faida hazijakuwa wazi . Ruto amefaulu kuzitekeleza vipi baadhi ya ahadi hizo na ni zipi? Iwapo kuna bidhaa inayowakilisha mahangaiko ya maisha ya kila siku kwa mwananchi wa kawaida Kenya ,basi  ni unga wa mahindi . Rais ,akiwa mgombeaji wa urais  miezi mitatu iliyopita aliahidi kuteremesha bei ya unga wa mahidni hadi shilingi 70 kwa pakiti ya kilo mbili. Hadi sasa ushahidi bado upo wa  uzito wa jukumu hilo . Rais na naibu wake Rigathi Gachagua wamewaambia wananchi kuwa wavumilivu kwani wanahitaji muda zaidi kutimiza hilo. Kwa wengi,huenda safari hiyo ikakomea hapo na kulea matumaini zaidi ya ahadi hiyo kutimizwa hivi karibuni ni jambo ambalo hawatakubali kulifanya . Utawala wake uliondoa ruzuku kwa bidhaa kama unga na mafuta,jambo ambalo baadhi ya wadadisi walisema liliharakishwa. Lakini Serikali mpya ilidai ruzuku haikuwa suluhisho la kudumu . Bei ya mbolea hata hivyo ilipunguzwa kutoka shilingi 6000 hadi 3500 ili kuhakikisha wakulima wanafanikisha uzalishaji wa mazao. Afueni  ya  hatua hiyo itahitaji muda ,na sio siku 100 . Ruto aliahidi kurekebisha uchumi kwa kupunguza deni la serikali, kupunguza bei ya bidhaa muhimu, na kuunda ""hustler fund"" kutoa mkopo wa kibinafsi kwa Mkenya yeyote aliye na  simu ya rununu .. Lakini kitendo chake cha kwanza baada ya kushika wadhifa huo ilikuwa kupunguza ruzuku ya chakula na mafuta iliyoletwa na mtangulizi wake Uhuru Kenyatta. Huku Ruto akisema kuwa afua hizo ""hazikuzaa matunda yoyote"", kuondolewa kwao kulikuwa ombi kutoka kwa Shirika la Fedha la Kimataifa, IMF, mkopeshaji mkuu Kenya. Benki Kuu ya Kenya ilipandisha viwango vya riba kwa jumla ya asilimia 1.75 mwaka wa 2022, idadi kubwa zaidi katika kipindi cha miaka saba, huku mfumuko wa bei ulipanda hadi kufikia kiwango cha juu cha miaka mitano cha asilimia 9.6 mwezi Oktoba. Iwapo maamuzi ya utawala mpya yangebadilisha mambo kuwa bora  ama kuleta afueni ni jambo litakalohitaji muda kutathmini lakini huo ndio uhalisia wa mambo siku 100 baadaye .  Iwapo kuna kundi  lililobeba matumaini makubwa ya kushuhudia ufanisi katika uakilishi sawa wa kijisnia katika serikali ya Ruto ni wanawake . Alitoa ahadi ambayo hata ilitiwa Saini katika mkataba maalum na makundi ya wanawake kwamba nusu ya baraza lake la mawaziri itakuwa na wanawake . Alipotangaza  baraza hilo ,ahadi hiyo ilitupwa kapuni na  ni wanawake saba  pekee ndio walioteuliwa katika baraza la watu 22. Mambo hayakuboreka hata wakati makatibu  wa kudumu wa wizara walipotangazwa . Huenda ulikuwa mkosi wa mwanzo wa kuzima matumaini makubwa ya kuwapa wanawake sauti zaidi ili wajiwekee msingi wa kuafikia ubora zaidi wa uwezo wao katika masuala ya uongozi na usimamizi wa masuala ya serikali na nchi yao . Iwapo kuna ahadi ya Ruto iliyokodolewa macho na kungojewa na wengi hasa wafuasi wake basi ni hii ya kutoa mikopo ya shilingi bilioni  50 kwa mahasla. Wengi wa wafuasi wake wanaojitambua kama watu wa kipato cha chini waliitegemea  ahadi hii kuwa kitovu cha mafanikio yao . Hata hivyo baada ya hazina hiyo kuanzishwa na rais Ruto,maoni yanayokinzana yamejitokeza ,lakini kikubwa ni iwapo azma ya hazina hii itatimizwa iwapo kiasi cha fedha wanazopewa watu na hali ya sasa ya  mfumko wa bei za bidhaa vinawiiana kuleta athari yoyote kubwa katika kufumua nyenzo za  kiuchumi . Kwanza ahadi ilikuwa ya kutoa  hela hizo bila riba  lakini  sasa mkopo huo  unakuja na riba  ya asilimia 8 na unafaa kulipwa ndani ya siku 14 . Watu wengi wanaoomba mkopo wanalalama kwamba kiasi wanachopewa hakiwezi kuwakwamua kutoka lindi la mahitaji yao ya kimsingi na dharura  kwani wengi wanapewa chini ya shilingi 1000. Endapo hilo litakuja kutulia na manufa ya hazina hii kudhihirika ni jambo linalohitaji muda na macho  kuangalia . Kunao wanaosema heri nusu shari kuliko kamili na hatua ya rais kuitekeleza ahadi yenyewe licha  ya kuibadilisha pakubwa ni nzuri na wameikaribisha .  Hakuna asiyetambua kwamba uchaguzi uliopita nchini Kenya ulizua mgawanyiko mkubwa miongoni mwa watu na taasisi za serikali. Hakuna mfano mzuri wa mgawanyiko huo kama ilivyodhihirika ndani ya tume huru ya uchaguzi na mipaka IEBC. Licha ya rais Ruto kuapa kuliponya taifa na kumaliza migawanyiko iliyosababishwa na uchaguzi uliopita ,hatua ya serikali kuwatimua afisini makamishna wanne wa tume ya IEBC ambao walipinga ushindi wake imetafsiriwa na wakosoaji wa rais kama  hila ya kisiasa ambayo ina hatari ya kuzidisha mpasuko nchini . Washirika wa rais wanasema uamuzi huo ni wa kuwaajibisha maafisa hao ambao inadaiwa  'walihatarisha nchi’ kwa kupinga ushindi wa Ruto lakini kwa upande mwingine imechukuliwa kama mwanzo wa ajenda  ya hila dhidi ya wenye maoni tofauti na ya rais na serikali yake . Iwapo mkondo utasalia huo na upinzani kulitumia suala hilo kama ajenda ya kuendelea kukoka moto wa kisiasa nchini,huenda utulivu unaohitaji kwa hatua nyingine za ustawishaji  wa nchi zikalemazwa na safari isiyofika mwisho ya siasa za  uchaguzi mmoja hadi mwingine nchini Kenya .  Rais Ruto tangu mwanzoni aliahidi kuhakikisha kwamba anadumisha uhuru wa idara ya mahakama na kuipa ufadhili inavyohitajika . Aliwateua majaji sita ambao mtangulizi wake Uhuru Kenyatta alidinda kuwateua . Hilo Pamoja na kuahidi kutoa ufadhili kwa idara ya mahakama ni mambo ambayo yamepokelewa na hisia mseto kulingana na unayemuuliza kupata jibu . Kulingana na  mtaalam wa masuala ya utawala bora Calvin Muga ,Kwa wafuasi wa Ruto hatua hiyo ni nzuri kufanikisha upatikanaji wa haki lakini kwa wakosoaji wake ,kuna mengi yanayojitokeza . Kiongozi wa Azimio Raila Odinga amemshtumu Ruto kwa ‘kuiteka’ idara ya mahakama. Kwanza hakufurahishwa na uamuzi wa mahakama ya juu Zaidi kuidhinisha ushindi wa Ruto na pili upinzani umetafsiri kwa njia tofauti hatua ya mahakama za Kenya kutupilia mbali  kesi zilizokuwa zikiwakabili viongozi wanaodaiwa kuwa washirika wa rais William Ruto. Katika msururu wa kesi hizo -wiki hii ,kesi ya mauaji dhidi ya Waziri wa Utumishi wa Umma  Aisha Jumwa ilitupiliwa mbali na mahakama na ile ya ufisadi dhidi ya aliyekuwa gavana wa Nairobi Mike Sonko kufutwa pia . Muga anasema Upinzani unachukulia ushirikiano huo wa ‘msaada wa kufanikisha Mahakama’ kutoka kwa rais kama wenye matarajio ya  ‘maamuzi’ yanayoegemea upande mmoja  lakini hilo lipo tu katika ndimi ila hakuna  ushahidi wa wazi kuhusu madai hayo kwani kikatiba idara ya mahakama ina uhuru wake unaofaa kuendesha mwongozo wake wa utendakazi na huduma kwa wananchi . Rais pia ana kibarua cha kudumisha maridhiano katika teuzi za maafisa wa serikali anazofanya ili kutosheleza mahitaji na maslahi ya kimaeneo na kijamii nchini . Minong’ono ya hapa na pale kuhusu wanaoteuliwa  huenda imekuwa ya kimya kimya lakini inaweza kulipuka  baadaye na kuunda msingi mbovu wa utawala wake katika siku zijazo . Uhusiano wake na bunge pia umewekwa katika darubini. Ameonekana kuwapendelea wabunge chipukizi kushikilia nafasi za uongozi wa bunge na kamati za bunge . Hili kwa wafuasi wake ni jambo zuri kwani alitoa ahadi kwa vijana kuwapa nafasi na sauti katika utawala wake  na pia uhusiano wa akribu na bunge unarahisisha ufanisi  wa ajenda za utungaji sheria na sera . Kwa wakosoaji wake ,rais anawatumia vijana wasio na uzoefu ili aweze kuwashawishi  na kupinda maamuzi ya taasisi kama bunge kwa manufaa yake. Kufahamu athari na ukweli wa madai ya pande zote mbili,ni jambo litakalohitaji muda kuona faida na hasara zake . Rais Ruto pia ana kibarua cha kuainisha  kauli na vitendo vya maafisa wa serikali yake kuhusu masuala muhimu yanayohusu nchi . Mawaziri wake  Mithika Linturi na Moses Kuria  kwa mfano ,wameonekana kutoa kauli zinazokinzana kuhusu kuagizwa kwa vyakula vya GMO nchini . Tofauti kama hizo zinapunguza Imani ya wananchi kwautawala huu ,kulingana na mtaalam wa masuala ya utawala bora Calvin Muga . Iwapo kuna kibarua kwa utawala huu ili kuanza kufanikisha kikamilifu  ahadi ilitoa kwa Wakenya  basi jukumu litaanza na kukomesha wimbo wa lawama kwa utawala uliotangulia na kufanya maamuzi na kuchukua hatua za kuleta afueni kwa wananchi wanaolalamikia gharama ya juu ya maisha au kuondoa vikwazo njia ili kuwawezesha wengi wenye uwezo kujitafutia kipato.","kwa kawaida kwa wengi wakati wakati.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/articles/cprl0pwj8jzo,"Muingereza Leon Edwards alimbwaga Kamaru Usman kwa hisia kali na kushinda taji la uzito wa welter kwenye UFC 278 huko Salt Lake City, Utah. Nyuma ya pointi katika nafasi ya tano, Edwards, 30, alipiga mkwaju wa juu wa kushoto na kumshangaza mpiganaji nambari moja wa Nigeria mwenye pauni kwa pauni. Edwards anakuwa bingwa wa kwanza wa Uingereza tangu Michael Bisping mnamo 2016 na wa pili tu katika historia. ""Nyinyi nyote mlinitia shaka, mkisema singeweza kufanya hivyo - niangalieni sasa,"" Edwards alisema.""Nimetoka kwenye mitaro. Nimejengwa hivi. Nimetiliwa shaka maisha yangu yote lakini niangalie sasa."" Katika hatua ya kumshinda Usman, Edwards wa Birmingham analipiza kisasi cha kushindwa kwake mwaka wa 2015 na kuhitimisha rekodi ya mchezaji huyo mwenye umri wa miaka 35 ya mapambano ya 15 bila kushindwa katika UFC. Edwards mzaliwa wa Jamaica, ambaye alikuwa chini ya kiwango kikubwa na wabahatishaji katika pambano hilo, anaendeleza mfululizo wake wa ushindi hadi 10 kufuatia kushindwa kwa Usman miaka saba iliyopita. Usman alishinda pambano la kwanza kwa kutumia mieleka yake kudhibiti wingi wa shindano hilo - mbinu ambayo Edwards anasema ilifungua macho yake kuona udhaifu katika mchezo wake wa kuhangaika. Katika raundi ya kwanza alimshinda Usman, na kuwa mpiganaji wa kwanza katika historia ya UFC kukamilisha kuchukua kwa Mnigeria huyo. Usman alijibu kwa nguvu katika raundi ya pili na ya tatu, akimshinikiza Edwards kwa migomo ya mfululizo na kudhibiti sehemu kubwa ya shindano hilo kwa kuhangaika kwake. Mwishoni mwa mzunguko wa kona ya Edwards kwa sauti kubwa alimsihi mpiganaji wao kuongeza mchezo wake na ""kusogeza mikono yake"". Edwards alianza kuonyesha dalili za uchovu katika mechi ya nne, iliyoletwa na mvutano mkali kutoka kwa Usman, huku bingwa akitua chini na kuendelea kudhibiti pambano hilo. Huku Usman akiwa mbele kwa pointi za kuingia Edwards ya tano alihitaji kitu maalum - na Briton aliwasilisha. Kwa mbwembwe alivuta kichwa cha Usman pembeni, kabla ya kutua kwa mkwaju safi wa kushoto, na kumwacha Mnigeria huyo akiduwaa kwenye turubai. Edwards aliruka kwenye ngome katika kusherehekea huku ukubwa wa kile alichokipata ukianza kuzama. Mchambuzi Joe Rogan alisema kiki iliyohitimisha pambano hilo huenda ikawa bora zaidi kuwahi kuonekana kwenye UFC, huku Edwards akimshtua Usman katika nafasi ya tano huku akiwa nyuma kwa pointi na bila shaka ndiye mchezaji mkubwa zaidi kuwahi kusumbua katika mchezo huo. Edwards alizaliwa na kukulia Kingston, Jamaica, kabla ya kuhamia Uingereza akiwa na umri wa miaka tisa. Baba yake alikuwa kiongozi wa genge huko Jamaica, ambayo ilimaanisha kwamba Edwards alikabiliwa na vurugu za magenge, ikiwa ni pamoja na kupigwa risasi, tangu umri mdogo. Akiwa na umri wa miaka 13 babake Edwards aliuawa, jambo ambalo lilimsukuma katika tamaduni ya magenge ya Birmingham, kabla ya hatimaye kutoroka kupitia sanaa ya kijeshi iliyochanganywa alipojiunga na gym ya mapigano miaka minne baadaye. Mafunzo katika MMA ndiyo njia ambayo Edwards alihitaji kuelekeza nguvu zake katika kitu chanya, na kujitolea kwake kulionyesha alipopanda daraja baada ya kujiunga na UFC. Kufuatia ushindi dhidi ya Usman, Edwards mwenye hisia kali alitoa pongezi kwa mama yake. ""Nilizaliwa Jamaica bila chochote. Niliishi kwenye banda la mbao lililoezekwa kwa zinki. Nitazame sasa, alisema. ""Pauni kwa pauni, risasi ya kichwa, imekufa. kwisha maneno. “Nilisema inawezekana, tunaweza kushinda mkanda kutoka Uingereza, nilikuambia. Aliendelea: ""Nataka kwanza kumshukuru Mungu. Mama, nakupenda, nilikuambia nitakufanyia, nilikuambia nitabadilisha maisha yako. ""Wiki nzima nilihisi kama huu ni wakati wangu, kila kitu huko nyuma, miaka miwili, janga, niangalie sasa, mimi ni bingwa wa ulimwengu. ""Asante Dana [Mzungu - rais wa UFC], na kwa UFC kwa kutoa fursa kwa mtoto ambaye alizaliwa bila kitu, asante."" Kamera zilimwonyesha Edwards akilia kwenye simu ya video na mama yake nyuma ya jukwaa kufuatia pambano hilo, akisema ""Nilikuambia mama, ningefanya hivyo"" huku picha zaidi zikionyesha sherehe zisizo za kawaida kwenye ukumbi wake wa mazoezi huko Birmingham.","'English Leon Edwards defeated Kamaru Usman by split decision at UFC 278 in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Pia, ameagiza Taasisi ya Kuzuia na Kupambana na Rushwa (Takukuru) kufanya uchunguzi baada ya kuhisi kuwepo kwa vitendo  vya ufisadi ikiwemo baadhi ya makampuni kulipwa fedha kwa ajili ya kutengeneza mifumo, lakini kazi haikufanyika. Akizungumza leo Jumamosi Desemba 4,2021 wakati akizindua gati katika Bandari ya Dar es Salaam,Rais Samia amesema kuna madudu mengi yanayofanywa ndani ya mamlaka hizo. Amesema licha ya baadhi ya madudu hayo kuoneshwa kwenye ripoti ya Mkaguzi na Mdhibiti Mkuu wa Hesabu za Serikali (CAG), lakini mpaka sasa hakuna hatua zilizochukuliwa. Rais Samia amesema bado kuna mianya ya uvujaji wa mapato katika mamlaka kutokana na mifumo ya malipo kuchezewa na wafanyakazi. ""Mkurugenzi nimekuleta hapa kusimamia bandari, Takukuru naomba, naagiza, natoa amri uchukue hatua dhidi ya watu hawa haraka sana na kama ripoti hiyo hamna nitawapatia ya nini kilichofanyika hapa. Watu waliofanya hayo wapo bado ofisini…watu tunachekeana tu, tunatizamana tu. Watu wapo maofisini wanaendeleza wizi na ubadhirifu wa mali za umma. ""Mifumo imekuwa ikichezewa, inaonyesha kuwa mizigo imelipiwa kutoka getini, lakini sio kweli haijalipiwa hivyo bandari kukosa mapato. Haya mapato yanayoonekana leo hayakupaswa kuwa hivyo yalivyo. Kama tungechukua hatua kudhibiti wizi huu tungekuwa mbali sana kwenye kukusanya mapato,"" amesema Rais Samia na kuongeza: ''Nimepata fursa ya kupitia taarifa ya ukaguzi maalumu wa kiuchunguzi wa mfumo wa mapato,unaotumika ndani ya mamlaka ya bandari, niliona fedha nyingi zilizotumika kuajiri makampuni mbalimbali ya kuanzisha mifumo ya kielektroniki ya ukusanyaji wa mapato ambayo haikutoa tija iliyokusudiwa. Kwa mfano mamlaka bila kuwa na mpango mkakati wa TEHAMA, na bila kushirikisha mamlaka ya Serikali Mtandao iliajiri makampuni kadhaa kuweka mifumo mbalimbali ya ukusanyaji ndani ya bandari,Ipo kampuni iliingia mkataba wa Sh694 milioni na ililipwa Sh600 milioni lakini haikumaliza kazi iliyotakiwa na mkataba ukavunjwa.

Huu hapa ni uvumbuzi 10 tulioweza kukukusanyia. 1. Roboti ya 'Doctor Car' Mwanafunzi kutoka shule ya   Dakar Polytechnic School nchini  Senegal alijenga roboti inayoweza kufanya mambo mbalimbaliiliyotengenezwa kwa ajili ya kupunguza hatari ya maambukizi ya  wahudumu kutoka kwa wagonjwa wa Covid-19. Chombo hicho kina kamera na kinaweza kuongozwa kufanya kazi kwa mbali kwa kutumia app.  Walioitengeneza wanasema inaweza kuzunguka katika vyumba vya wagonjwa waliowekwa karantini kuchukua vipimo vyao vya joto la mwili  na kuwapelekea chakula na dawa. 2. Mashine ya kunawa mikono Kiosha mikono Mvulana mwenye umri wa miaka tisa mwanafunzi nchini Kenya  Stephen Wamukota alivumbua mashine ya mbao ya kunawa mikono ili kusaidia  kukabiliana na kusambaa kwa virusi vya corona. Mashine inawawezesha watumiaji kuchota maji kwenye ndoo ya maji kunawa mikono yao kwa kutumia ubao unaokanyagwa kwa mguu. Hii inawasaidia watumiaji kuepuka kugusa mahali popote na mikono yao na kupunguza hatari ya maambukizi. Stephen alipewa tuzo na rais mwezi Juni. 3. The Respire-19 portable ventilator  ( kifaa kinachosaidia kupumua) Huku kukiwa na upungufu wa mashine zinazosaidia wagonjwa kupumua katika wodi za wagonjwa wa  Covid-19 wards in nchini  Nigeria, mwanafunzi wa uhandisi  mwenye umri wa miaka 20 nchini Nigeria  Usman Dalhatu alijaribu kusaidia kupunguza upungufu huo. Dalhatu alitengeneza ventilator inayotumiwa moja kwa moja ili kuwasaidia watu wenye matatizo ya kupumua ambayo mara nyingi husababishwa na maambukizi ya virusi vya corona. Sasa anapanga kutengeneza  mashine hizo 20. 4. Chapisho la 3D Natalie Raphil ni muasisi wa kampuni ya Intelijensia gudhi ya  -Robots Can Think South Africa. Anatumia mfumo wa 3D wa matbaa kutengeneza barakoa 100 kwa siku  katika baadhi ya hospitali kuu za Johannesburg. Afrika Kusini ina nusu ya idadi ya watu wote wenye virusi vya corona waliohesabiwa barani Afrika. 5. Solar-powered hand-washing sink (Siki ya kunawa mikono inayotumia miale ya jua) Wakati ilipowekwa tahadhari ya kutotoka nje nchini Ghana  iliyolenga kukabiliana na Covid-19, mtengenezaji  viatu Richard Kwarteng  na kaka yake   Jude Osei waliamua kutengeneza beseni ya kunawa mikono inayotumia miale ya jua. Wakati mikono inapokaribia kifaacha utambuzi  kwenye beseni, maji ya sabuni hutoka moja kwa moja . King'ora hulia kwa sekunde 25 baadae za kunawa mikono- kipindi ambacho kinashauriwa na Shirika la Afya Duniani (WHO) cha kunawa mikono. 6.  Mashine ya  X-ray iliyotengenezwa kwa mtandao yakupima mapafu Wahandisi nchini  Tunisia  wamebuni jukwa la mtandao ambalo linafanya uchunguzi wa skani (scan) kwa kutumia X-ray kujaribu kubaini iwapo mtu anaweza kuwa anaumwa virusi vya corona. Wakati  X-ray inapopakuliwa kwenye jukwa hilo, hufanya vipimo kubaini dalili zinazoweza kuwa ni za maambukizi ya virusi vya corona. Watafiti katika Taasisi ya sayansi na teknolojia nchini Tunisia wanasema kuwa kifaa hicho hubaini asilimia 90 ya dalili zinazoweza kuwa za maabukizi ya corona. Jukwaa hilo bado linatengenezwa, lakini  vipimo maelfu kadhaa  vya X-ray vya mapafu  vimekua vikiingizwa ndani ya mfumo ili kuuwezesha kutambua athari za   Covid-19  kwa mapafu. 7. Roboti za polisi katika doria ya 'lockdown' Maafisa nchini Tunisi walituma roboti polisi kwenye mitaa ya mji mkuu mwezi Aprili ili kuhakikisha watu wanazingatia hatua zilizotangazwa za amri ya kutotoka nje. Uchunguzi wa roboti , zinazofahamika kama PGuards,  uliwafuatilia watu waliokuwa wakitembea katika mtaa na kuwasogelea na kuwauliza ni kwanini walikuwa nje wakati wa amri ya kutotoka nje. Waliopatikana na kosa hilo walilazimika kuonyesha vitambulisho vyao na nyaraka nyingine  kwenye kamera iliyopo kwenye roboti hizo.  Roboi hizo zenye magurudumu manne zina kamera na mwanga  wa utambuzi  na imeunganishwa  na teknolojia nyingine kadhaa za mawasiliano. 8. Sanitizer iliyotengenezwa kwa ubao Wakala wa usambazaji wa pesa kwa njia ya simu ya mkononi nchini Kenya-Danson Wanjohi alitengeneza chombo cha mbao ambacho kinaweza kusafisha au kutakasa pesa  za noti ambazo zinapitishwa katika .

Kila mtu aliye na ufuasi mkubwa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii na mnablogu anapaswa kujaza fomu inayoeleza taarifa kumhusu ikiwemo washirika wake na mipango yao ya kifedha. Baada ya kujaza fomu hizo, kila mmoja atapewa kibali kitakachomruhusu kuendelea na kazi yake. Baadhi ya watu walioitwa kujiandikisha wana kampuni ambazo zimesajiliwa na zinafanya kazi kisheria kama vile mashirika ya habari, lakini hata hivyo wanafaa kujiandikisha tena. Wote hawa wanafaa kuandikisha shughuli wanazofanya kama biashara rasmi na wanafaa kufuatilia kanuni za maadili kwa waandishi wa habari, hata kama wengi wao si wanahabari. Pia wanapaswa kuwasilisha mikataba ya ajira inayo onyesha sharia na masharti ya kazi zao. Mamlaka ya Uganda inasema atakaye kosa kufuata maagizo ya UCC hataruhusiwa kuendelea kutoa huduma za mawasiliano na huenda tovuti au kurasa wanazomiliki zikafungiwa. Ibrahim Bbosa msemaji wa UCC nchini Uganda anasema sheria inawapa mamlaka kufuatilia huduma za mawasiliano hata zilizo kwenye mitandao ya kijamii. ""Watumiaji mitandao na washawishi katika mitandao ya kijamii waliofika kiwango cha kusambaza mawasiliano na wanaotumia mitandao kwa biashara  wanahitajika kujisajili na mratibu ambaye ni UCC.""

Makundi ya kutetea haki za binaadamu yanasema serikali nchini humo inaonekana kona mitandao ya kijamii kama tishio na inataka  kuifuatilia na kubana matumizi yake. Bettina Praise Tumuhaise, ni mmoja wa waganda walio na ufuasi mkubwa kwenye mitandao ya kijamii. Anatumia mtandao wake kutangaza habari kuhusu ukulima na burudani, anasema huu ni mpango mpya wa serikali kuweza kulazimisha watu wanaolipa kodi kulipa ya ziada. 'Wajitokeze watueleze tu wanachotaka, wanajificha tu, au wanataka kututumia katika siku zijazo, hususan unafahamu kwanini... Na kama ni hilo, basi watupigie na watuambie,'jamani tunajua munafanya kazi nzuri, tunawahitaji' anaeleza Bettina. Wengine wanasema serikali inajaribu kufukuza watu kwenye mitandao ya kijami na utumiaji wa intaneti kwa ujumla. 'Tunapata pesa kutokana na mitandao ya kijamii lakini tuna makampuni yaliosajiliwa. Na tunalipa kodi kwa makampuni hayo. Kujisajili tena ni usajili wa mara ya pili. Wanataka tulipe pesa zaidi na zaidi na pengine kupunguza idadi ya watu wanaotumia mitandao ya kijamii Uganda.'

Sheria yamaudhui mitandaoni Tanzania Hatua kama ya Uganda iliidhinishwa katika nchi jirani mwaka jana baada ya serikali kushinda kesi iliofunguliwa na wadau wa habari kupinga kanuni za maudhui mitandaoni 2018. Kanuni hizo zilizosainiwa na waziri mwenye dhamana ya habari ambazo pamoja na mambo mengine zilinuiwa kusimamia usajili na kuweka mfumo wa uwajibikaji na maadili kwa wamiliki wa mitandao ya kijamii inayohusika na habari nchini humo. ''Kwa hukumu hiyo , tunatumia fursa hii kuutarifu umma kuwa sasa wamiliki wa mitandao ya kijamii inayohusika na usambazaji wa habari kama blogu, TV na redio za mitandaoni na wengine walioainishwa katika kanuni wanapaswa kuendelea kujisajili na kufuata maadili kwa mujibu wa kanuni husika'', ilisema serikali katika taarifa yake. Wanaotuma maombi huhitajika kuwasilisha stakabadhi zao ikiwemo maelezo ya hisa, uraia, kibali cha kuonesha wanalipa kodi mbali na mipango ya mafunzo.

Maseneta 11 wa Republican na maseneta wateule, wakiongozwa na Ted Cruz, wanataka kura ya kuidhinisha ushindi wa Biden kuchelewasha kwa siku 10 ili kuchunguza madai ya wizi wa kura. Hatua hiyo huenda isifaulu kwa sababu maseneta wengi wanatarajiwa kupiga kura ya kumuidhinisha Bw. Biden bungeni Januari tarehe 6. Bw. Biden, ambaye ni mwanachama wa Democratic, ataapishwa rasmi kuwa rais wa Marekani Januari 20. Rais Donald Trump amekataa kushindwa katika uchaguzi mkuu wa Novemba 3, na kudai mara kadhaa kwamba uchaguzi huo ulikubwa na udanganyifu bila kutoa ushahidi wowote. Bw. Pence amekaribia kuunga mkono madai ya wizi wa kura. Lkaini siku ya Jumamosi, mkuu wa watumishi wake Marc Short alisema  Bw.

Biden. Baada ya maseneta kadhaa wa Republican kutangaza azma ya kupinga matokeo ya uchaguzi katika Congress, ni wazi kwamba chama cha Republican kiliunga mkono juhudi za Donald Trump za kutengua ushindi wa urais. Juhudi hizi hata hivyo hazitafua dafu, ikizingariwa kwamba chama cha Democratic kina wabunge wengi katika bunge la wawakilishi, lakini lengo la  wanasiasa hawa sio kufanya mabadiliko yoyote kimiujiza. Badala yake, bali wanataka kumhakikishia Bw. Trump uaminifu wao. Wanashikilia kuwa ufanisi wa chama cha Republican utaendelezwa  kupitia Trump na washirika wake, ambao huenda wakamtegemea katika azma yao ya kuwa rais, kama vile seneta Ted Cruz wa Texas au Josh Hawley wa Missouri, ama wale ambao wanatarajia kupingwa na wanasiasa wanaomuunga mkono Trump.

All 50 states have certified the election results, some using legal arguments to count the votes and the laws. Currently, US courts are considering 60 lawsuits challenging Biden’s certification. After the Republican resolution to challenge the election results in Congress gained confidence to challenge the election results in Congress, it is significant that the Republican party is supporting Trump’s claims. These claims, despite not being fully accepted, are believed to be supported by many Democratic members of the legislative body, but they are not making any changes. Instead, they want to confirm Trump’s victory. The Republican party is supporting its candidate through Trump and his supporters, as seen in Ted Cruz of Texas or Josh Hawley of Missouri, or those who have been opposing the certification, such as Trump. This is the first time members of Congress are challenging the presidential election results in a process that is meant to certify the winner.'

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-59401107,"Mashujaa wa Olimpiki wa Ethiopia Haile Gebrselassie na Feyisa Lilesa wanasema wako tayari kwenda mstari wa mbele katika vita dhidi ya vikosi vya waasi. Tangazo lao linakuja baada ya Waziri Mkuu Abiy Ahmed kusema atakuwa mstari wa mbele  kuongoza vita. Waasi wa Tigray wanasema wanaelekea mji mkuu wa Addis Ababa. Ujerumani na Ufaransa ni nchi za hivi punde kuwashauri raia wao kuondoka Ethiopia, huku taharuki ya kuzuka kwa vita vya wenyewe kwa wenyewe ikipanda. Siku ya Jumanne mjimbe wa Marekani katika eneo hilo Jeffrey Feltman alionya kuwa maendeleo ya muda ya kidiplomasia kuelekea kumaliza mzozo huo yanahatarishwa na matukio ya kutisha mashinani. Waasi hao mapema wiki hii walisema wamechukua udhibiti wa Shewa Robit, mji ulioko umbali wa kilomita 225 kaskazini mashariki mwa Addis Ababa. Madai hayo hayajathibitishwa. Huku Bw Abiy akienda kuongoza juhudi za vita, naibu wake, Demeke Mekonnen Hasse, alikuwa amechukua jukumu la shughuli za kawaida za serikali, msemaji alinukuliwa na vyombo vya habari vinavyohusishwa na serikali akisema. Tangazo la Bw Abiy limeimarisha usajili jeshini, huku mamia ya wanajeshi wapya wakihudhuria sherehe, iliyoadhimishwa kwa nyimbo za kizalendo, mjini Addis Ababa siku ya Jumatano. Hapo awali, Gebrselassie, 48, alinukuliwa na televisheni ya taifa akisema kuwa uamuzi wa Bw Abiy kwenda vitani ""unatarajiwa kutoka kwa kiongozi anayeipenda nchi yake"". ""Nipo tayari kufanya lolote linalotakiwa kwangu ikiwa ni pamoja na kwenda vitani,"" alisema. Gebrselassie anachukuliwa kuwa shujaa nchini Ethiopia, na maoni yake yalionekana kama jaribio la kukusanya uungwaji mkono wa umma nyuma ya juhudi za vita. Wakati wa maisha yake ya miaka 25 kama mwanariadha, alishinda medali mbili za dhahabu za Olimpiki, ushindi nane wa Ubingwa wa Dunia na kuweka rekodi 27 za ulimwengu. Alitangaza kustaafu riadha mnamo 2015. Akielezea kuunga mkono vita hivyo, Feyisa, 31, alinukuliwa na tovuti ya shirika la habari la Fana inayoshirikiana na serikali akisema kuwa Bw Abiy amefanya ""uamuzi sahihi"" kwa kusema atakwenda vitani kukabiliana na waasi. Aliongeza kuwa yeye pia alikuwa tayari kupata msukumo kutoka kwa ""ushujaa wa mababu zangu"" na kwenda mstari wa mbele ""kuokoa nchi yangu"". Mwanariadha huyo alishinda medali ya fedha katika mbio za marathon katika michezo ya Olompiki ya Rio mwaka 2016. Alipata umaarufu kwa kuinua mikono yake ikiwa imepishana kana kwamba imefungwa pingu ili kuvutia tahadhari ya kimataifa kuhusu ukandamizaji dhidi ya waandamanaji wanaodai mageuzi ya kisiasa nchini Ethiopia. Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) kilikuwa chama kikuu serikalini wakati huo.Kufuatia maandamano hayo, Bw Abiy alikua waziri mkuu na TPLF ikapoteza udhibiti wa nchi iliyokuwa imeshikilia kwa miaka 27. Baadaye ilirejea kwenye ngome yake ya Tigray, ambako ilianzisha uasi Novemba mwaka jana baada ya mzozo mkubwa na Bw Abiy kuhusu mageuzi yake. Vita hivyo vimezua mzozo mkubwa wa kibinadamu, na kusababisha maelfu ya watu kupoteza maisha, mamilioni kutoka makwao, na laki kadhaa katika hali kama ya njaa wakati mashirika ya misaada yanapambana kufikisha chakula katika maeneo yaliyoathiriwa na vita. Matarajio ya baadhi ya wanamichezo wanaoheshimika zaidi wa Ethiopia wanaoelekea kwenye mstari wa mbele kupigana kunaashiria kitu kikubwa na cha nguvu kuhusu hali ya Addis Ababa na kwingineko. Wakati wa mzozo mkali, Waethiopia wengi wanasiamama na waziri mkuu, na wana nia ya kutekeleza jukumu lao katika kukuza uungaji mkono wa umma kwa kampeni ya kijeshi ambayo imekumbwa na vikwazo visivyoweza kupingwa katika miezi ya hivi karibuni, ingawa mengi hayajafichuliwa kuhusu takwimu ya majeruhi na kasi ya uwanja wa vita. Ni wazi watu wengi wanaona tishio la kijeshi linaloletwa na tplf na washirika wao kama hali halisi kwa Ethiopia. Zaidi ya hayo ni chuki kubwa ya TPLF yenyewe, ambayo inatokana na miongo yake ya kuongoza serikali ya kitaifa ya kimabavu. Lakini kuna zaidi ya hilo. Waziri Mkuu ametaka kuionyesha nchi yake kama mwathirika, sio tu wa uvamizi wa Tigray, lakini njama kubwa ya kimataifa iliyopangwa kudhoofisha Ethiopia na kuiadhibu kwa madai, kupinga maslahi ya ukoloni wa Magharibi katika bara. Vyombo vya habari vya Magharibi vinaonyeshwa kama waungaji mkono kwa shauku wa nadharia hiyo ya njama - moja ambayo inaonekana kupata uaminifu mkubwa katika nchi inayojitahidi kuelezea jinsi kundi la waasi lingeweza kupiga hatua ya kushangaza. Umoja wa Afrika unaongoza juhudi za kupata mwisho wa upatanishi katika mzozo huo, lakini hakuna upande ambao umejitolea kushuriki katika mazungumzo. Siku ya Jumanne, wizara ya mambo ya nje ya Ujerumani ilisema raia wake wanapaswa kuondoka kwa safari za kwanza za ndege za kibiashara, huku Ufaransa ikiwataka raia wake kuondoka nchini humo ""bila kuchelewa"". Wakati huo huo hati ya ndani ya usalama ya Umoja wa Mataifa ilisema ""wanafamilia wanaostahiki wa wafanyikazi walioajiriwa kimataifa"" wanapaswa kuondolewa ifikapo tarehe 25 Novemba. Hapo awali Marekani na Uingereza zilitangaza kuwa wanawaondoa wafanyakazi wa kidiplomasia wasio wa muhimu, na kuwaambia raia wengine kuondoka. TPLF wanasonga mbele kuelekea Addis Ababa kwenye barabara kuu ya A2 hasa kusini zaidi kuliko Kemise.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-60298518,"Mwanamume aliyepooza kufuatia kukatika kwa uti wa mgongo  ameweza kutembea tena, kutokana na kipandikizi kilichotengenezwa na timu ya watafiti wa Uswizi. Ni mara ya kwanza mtu ambaye amekatwa kabisa uti wa mgongo kuweza kutembea bila msaada. Teknolojia hiyo hiyo imeboresha afya ya mgonjwa mwingine aliyepooza kiasi kwamba ameweza kuwa baba. Utafiti huo umechapishwa katika jarida la Nature Medicine. Michel Roccati alikuwa amepooza baada ya ajali ya pikipiki miaka mitano iliyopita. Uti wa mgongo wake ulikatwa kabisa na hakuwa na hisia hata kidogo katika miguu yake. Lakini sasa anaweza kutembea kwa sababu ya upandikizaji huo ambao umeunganishwa kwa njia ya upasuaji kwenye mgongo wake. Mtu aliyejeruhiwa kwa njia kama hii hajawahi kutembea hivi hapo awali. Watafiti hao wanasisitiza kuwa si tiba ya jeraha la uti wa mgongo na kwamba teknolojia hiyo bado ni ngumu sana kutumiwa katika maisha ya kila siku, lakini wanaipongeza kama hatua kuu ya kuboresha maisha. Haikuwa teknolojia pekee iliyochangia Michel kupona. Muitaliano huyo anasema alipopata ajali, alikuwa na azimio la kupta maendeleo kadiri awezavyo. ""Nilikuwa nikipiga ngumi, kukimbia na kufanya mazoezi ya mwili. Lakini baada ya ajali, sikuweza kufanya mambo ambayo nilipenda kufanya, lakini sikuruhusu hisia zangu kushuka. Sikuwahi kusimamisha safari yangu ya kupona, nilitaka kutatua tatizo hili."" Kasi ya kupona kwa Michel ilimshangaza daktari wa upasuaji wa mishipa ya fahamu ambaye aliingiza kipandikizi na kuunganisha kwa ustadi elektrodi kwenye nyuzi za neva. Utafiti huo umeungwa mkono na Dk Ram Hariharan, mshauri katika Hospitali Kuu huko Sheffield ambaye ni huru kutoka kwa timu ya utafiti na pia anazungumza kwa niaba ya Chama kinachohusika na c majeraha ya mgongo. ""Wamefanya jambo ambalo halijafanyika hapo awali. ""Sijasikia kuhusu utafiti wowote ambapo wameweka kipandikizi  kwa mgonjwa aliyekatwa kabisa uti wa mgongo kuweza  kuboresha usawa,  kusimama na kutembea."" ""Tunahitaji idadi zaidi ya wagonjwa  ili kuonyesha kwamba ni salama kwanza na kwamba inaboresha maisha yao kwa kiasi kikubwa. Hapo ndipo inaweza kuendelezwa."" Mishipa katika uti wa mgongo hutuma ishara kutoka kwa ubongo hadi kwa miguu. Baadhi ya watu wamepooza mishipa ya fahamu inapoharibika kutokana na kuumia. Kwa upande wa Michel hakuna ishara kabisa kwa miguu yake kwa sababu uti wa mgongo umekatika kabisa. Lakini kipandikizi hiki hutuma ishara moja kwa moja kwa miguu yake na kumwezesha kutembea, lakini wakati tu kipandikizi kimewashwa. Kufikia sasa watu tisa wamepokea kipandikizi na kurejesha uwezo wa kutembea. Hakuna hata mmoja wao anayeitumia kuwasaidia kutembea katika maisha yao ya kila siku  kwa sababu ni ngumu sana katika hatua hii. Badala yake, wanakitumia kufanya mazoezi ya kutembea  ambayo hufanyisha misuli yao mazoezi na kuboresha afya zao. David M'zee alikuwa mmoja wa wagonjwa wa kwanza kupokea upandikizaji huo. Kama Michel, aliweza kutembea na kipandikizi huku akitumia kifaa cha kumsaidia. Afya ya David iliimarika kiasi kwamba aliweza kupata mtoto wa kike na mpenzi wake Janine, jambo ambalo halikuwezekana baada ya ajali yake mwaka 2010. Bado kuna safari ndefu kabla ya teknolojia hiyo kutumiwa kusaidia watu waliopooza kutembea, kulingana na Prof Grégoire Courtine, aliyeongoza timu iliyounda teknolojia hiyo katika Chuo cha École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). ""Hii sio tiba ya jeraha la uti wa mgongo, lakini ni hatua muhimu ya kuboresha hali ya maisha ya watu. Tutawawezesha watu. Tutawapa uwezo wa kusimama na kutembea. Ni mafanikio makubwa."" Tiba itahitaji kuzaliwa upya kwa uti wa mgongo, matibabu ambayo bado yako katika hatua ya awali ya utafiti. Prof Courtine anaamini kwamba teknolojia yake ya kupandikiza inaweza kutumika pamoja na matibabu ya kurejesha neva pindi tiba itakapokuwa tayari.","'A man named Michel Roccati was one of the first to undergo this brain stimulation.

Kundi hilo la mtandao wa watetezi wa haki za wanyama, (ANAW) limesema kuwa punda wamekuwa wakitoweka haraka sana. Ripoti imesema tangu kufunguliwa kwa maeneo manne ya machinjio ya punda kwa ajili ya biashara mwaka 2016, ''idadi kubwa ya wanyama hao huchinjwa kila siku''. Inakadiriwa kuwa punda 410 huuawa kila siku. ANAW limesema kuwa ngozi ya punda inahitajika sana nchini China. Ripoti imeongeza kuwa suala hilo lilishawekwa wazi mwaka 2017. Wakati huo BBC iliporipoti kuhusu madai ya watu kulalamika kuibwa kwa punda wao ili kupelekwa kwenye soko. Lakini mkuu wa machinjio amesema: ''tunafurahia wachina, kwasababu awali tulikuwa hatupati chochote kutokana na punda, lakini watu wengi sasa wananufaika.'' Shirika la kuteteta haki za wanyama limetaka machinjio yote ya wanyama hao yafungwe. Ripoti ya shirika hilo inakadiria uwepo wa punda 900,000 mpaka milioni 1.8 nchini Kenya. Uzinduzi wa kichinjio cha punda Kichinjio cha kwanza cha Punda kilizinduliwa nchini Kenya mnamo 2014. Ilitokanana ongezeko la visa vya wizi wa wanyama hao ambao hutumiwa kubeba mizigo na kuchinjwa kisiri huku nyama yake ikiuziwa wateja wasiokuwa na habari kuwa wananunua nyama ya Punda. Kwa muda mrefu mizoga ya wanyama hao imekuwa ikipatikana kando ya barabara au msituni ambako wezi huificha baada ya kuwachinja. Mradi wa ujenzi wa kichinjio cha Punda uliidhinishwa katika mji wa Naivasha nje kidogo ya mji mkuu Nairobi. Kichinjio hicho ni cha kwanza Kenya cha nyama ya Punda. Kushamiri kwa biashara ya punda Shirika moja linalohusika na maslahi ya wanyama nchini Kenya, linasema bei ya Punda imepanda mara dufu nchini humo kwa sababu ya nyama ya mnyama huyo kuongezeka hasa katika taifa la china taifa ambalo hununua kwa wingi bidhaa ya mnyama huyo Kwa mujibu wa shirika hilo, sababu ya bei ya Punda kupanda kwa karibu asilimia 200 ni kutokana na ongezeka la biashara ya bidhaa za mnyama huyo huko Uchina ambako nyama ya punda ni kitoweo kilicho na walaji wengi. Mataifa kadhaa ya kiafrika yamepiga marufuku uuzaji ya nyama na bidhaa nyenginezo za punda, kwa ajili ya soko hilo la Uchina, kwa sababu punda ambao hutumiwa zaidi kwa ajili ya kusaidia kubeba mizigo mashambani, sasa idadi yao inapungua kwa kasi mno. Kuna hofu kuwa huenda baadhi ya watu wanawasafirisha punda kimagendo hadi machinjioni kutokana na kupanda kwa bei yake. Mataifa mengi yamepiga marufuku uchinjaji wa nyama ya punda yakiwemo mataifa kadhaa ya Afrika kama vile Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, na Senegal. Mataifa hayo aidha yameipiga marufuku China kununua ngozi ya punda kwani huenda ikamaliza kabisa wanyama hao duniani.

Mapema wakati wa mlipuko huo kulikuwa na hofu kwamba Ibruprofen  inaweza kuwa mbaya kwa matumizi ya wagonjwa iwapo watakuwa na dalili hafifu. Wasiwasi huo uliongezeka baada ya waziri wa afya nchini Ufaransa Olivier Veran kusema kwamba dawa kama Ibuprofen , zinaweza kuongeza maambukizi na akawataka wagonjwa kutumia dawa aina ya paracetamol badala yake. Uchunguzi uliofanywa na tume ya dawa za binadamu ulibaini kwamba Paracetamol , ilikuwa salama kutumia kukabiliana na dalili za corona. Dawa zote mbili zinaweza kupunguza viwango vya joto mwilini  na kukabiliana na dalili zinazohusishwa na homa ya flu. Kwa dalili hafifu za corona , Idara ya afya nchini Uingereza  inawashauri watu kutumia dawa aina ya paracetamol  kwanza  kwa kuwa ina madhara machache  badala ya Ibuprofen  na ni chaguo salama  kwa watu wengi.

Hii haimaanishi kuwa wachezaji hao wawili wenye sifa zaidi katika kandanda wamepunguza uwezo wao wa mapato, haswa nje ya uwanja, katika siku za hivi karibuni za maisha yao ya soka. Messi, 35, anatarajiwa kuingiza dola milioni 110 msimu huu (dola milioni 55 nje ya uwanja) huku Ronaldo, 37, akipangiwa kupata dola milioni 100 (dola milioni 60 nje ya uwanja, zaidi ya mchezaji mwingine yeyote). Wote wawili walitia saini mikataba ya faida kubwa na makampuni ya fedha za siri katika mwaka uliopita, huku Messi akipata dola milioni 20 kila mwaka kutoka Socios.com na Ronaldo akishirikiana na Binance kwa kiasi ambacho hakijawekwa wazi. Kwa jumla, wachezaji kumi wa soka wanaolipwa zaidi wanatarajiwa kukusanya mapato ya kabla ya ushuru ya $652 milioni msimu huu, juu ya 11% kutoka $585 milioni ya mwaka jana. Wachezaji walio katika nafasi za juu tatu  wanachangia zaidi ya 50% ya takwimu hiyo kulingana na Forbes. Licha ya kusaini na Roc Nation mnamo 2019, De Bruyne na baba yake waliongoza mazungumzo ambayo yalizaa kandarasi yake mpya na Manchester City, kwa kutumia usaidizi wa kampuni ya data ya Analytics FC katika mchakato huo.

Mchezaji huyo mwenye umri wa miaka 31 hapo awali alionekana kwenye jalada la mchezo wa video wa FIFA 20 wa EA Sports. Lewandowski amekuwa mwepesi kuhalalisha ada ya uhamisho ya takriban dola milioni 45 ambayo FC Barcelona ililipa mwaka 2022 kumnunua kutoka Bayern Munich, akiwa na mabao 12 katika mechi kumi alizocheza. alisitisha makubaliano ya  muda mrefu na Huawei kulingana na ripoti kwamba kampuni hiyo iliunga mkono uvamizi wa Urusi nchini Ukraine. Forbes inakadiria kuwa Haaland hupokea dola milioni 4 kila mwaka kutoka kwa wafadhili kama Hyperice, Samsung na Viaplay, lakini idadi hiyo inakaribia kuongezeka. Ripoti zinaonyesha kuwa mkataba unaofuata wa viatu wa Haaland unaweza kuwa na thamani ya dola milioni 18 kila mwaka. Mkataba wake wa awali na Nike uliisha mwaka huu.

Kwa miezi kadhaa, timu za madakrati wa upasuaji zilijaribu aina tofauti za mbinu kwa kutumia picha za mapacha hao katika teknolojia ya picha ambayo ilitegemea uchunguzi wa CT na MRI. Daktari wa upasuaji Noor ul Owase Jeelani alielezea kuwa ni kama ""kitu kutoka katika anga za juu"". Bernardo na Arthur ni moja ya michakato mgumu zaidi ya utengano ambao umefanikiwa, kulingana na taasisi ya Jeelani, Gemini Untwined. Alisema kuwa kwa mara ya kwanza, kikundi cha madaktari wa upasuaji kutoka nchi tofauti walivaa vifaa vya sauti na kufanya kazi ya upasuaji pamoja katika ‘chumba kilichowekwa teknolojia inayoonesha uhalisia wa upasuaji huo ‘ Mapacha hao wa Siamese walifanyiwa upasuaji mara 7: wa mwisho alihitaji upasuaji wa zaidi ya saa 27 na timu ya zaidi ya wataalamu 100 wa afya. ""Ni kama kuishi kwenye sayari ya Mars"" Akielezea kipengele cha video wakati wa upasuaji huo, Jeelanie aliliambia shirika la habari la PA: ""Inashangaza. Inapendeza sana kuona zoezi zima na kufanya upasuaji na kutowaweka watoto katika hatari ya aina yoyote."" ""Unaweza kufikiria jinsi hii inavyotia moyo kwa madaktari wa upasuaji."" ""Kwa njia fulani, shughuli hizi zinachukuliwa kuwa ngumu zaidi kwa wakati wetu na baada ya kuifanya katika hali halisi ya picha ni kama suala la kuishi kwenye Mars."" Alisema uchunguzi wa mwili wa watoto hao wakiume mapacha ilikuwa ngumu kutokana na ukuaji wa kovu baada ya majaribio ya awali kushindwa kuwatenganisha na kwamba ""anaogopa sana"" kuhusu upasuaji huo mgumu. Jeelani alisema ""alihuzunishwa sana"" lakini baada ya upasuaji huo wa saa 27, ambapo alichukua mapumziko mara nne tu ya dakika 15 kula na kunywa maji, ilikuwa ""ajabu"" kuona familia nzima ikiwa na furaha baadaye. Aliongeza kuwa, kama inavyotokea katika kesi zote za mapacha walioungana, shinikizo la damu la watoto na mapigo ya moyo ""yalipigwa shoti"" hadi walipounganishwa siku 4 baadaye na kushikana mikono. Mapacha hao walikuwa wakiendelea vyema hospitalini na wataendelea kupata matibabu kwa miezi sita. Huu ni upasuaji wa sita kwa Jeelani akiwa na Gemini Untwined, baada ya kufanya upasuaji wa mapacha nchini Pakistan, Sudan, Israel na Uturuki. Aliongoza utaratibu huo pamoja na Dk. Gabriel Mufarrej, mkuu wa upasuaji wa watoto katika Taasisi ya Ubongo ya Jimbo la Paulo Niemeyer nchini Brazili. Mufarrej alisema hospitali anayofanyia kazi imekuwa ikiwahudumia watoto hao kwa miaka miwili na nusu. Aliongeza kuwa kutenganishwa kutabadilisha maisha yao. ""Tangu walipofika Rio miaka miwili na nusu iliyopita kutoka nyumbani kwao katika mkoa wa Roraima, wazazi wa watoto hao wamekuwa sehemu ya familia hapa hospitalini.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-52216057,"Kwa wakristo wengi na wayahudi, huu ni wakati muhimu sana, katika mwaka. Ni wakati ambao wanajiandaa kusheherekea sikukuu ya Pasaka na ufufuko wa Yesu na Waislamu nao wakiwa wanajiandaa kwa ajili ya mwezi mtukufu wa Ramadhani. Imani zote tatu, kwa kawaida wakati huwa unawajumuisha watu katika mlo wa pamoja na sala. Lakini hali ni tofauti kwa sasa, mataifa mengi yanataka watu wasikaribiane na hivyo sherehe ambazo zimezoeleka kuwa ngumu kufanyika. Maadhimisho ya juma kuu la kukumbuka ukombozi wao  unaanza jioni ya Aprili 08, Sherehe hizo ni muhimu sana kwa kalenda ya Wayahudi. Wanakumbuka simulizi  ya kitabu cha kutoka na kipindi ambacho Wayahudi wanakumbuka jinsi Musa alivyowatoa mababu zao kwenye utumwa Misri. Jioni ya kwanza ya Pasaka , chakula maalum na ibada maalum inayofanyika katika nyumba za watu. Baadhi ya wayahudi ambao wanaishi nje ya Israel huwa wanaadhimisha  jioni  ya siku inayofuata. Huwa wanasheherekea 'Seder' ambayo watu huwa wanasoma, wanasimuliana simulizi mbalimbali, wanakula chakula maalumu na kuimba. Haya yote huwa yanafanyika wakati ambao familia na marafiki wamejumuika kwa pamoja  wakiwa wameizunguka meza. Tafrija hii huwa ni tamasha linalojumuisha watu kusheherekea uhuru na maisha. Sherehe hizi za Seder huwa zinahitaji watu wengi kusheherekea na sio familia peke yake. Lakini kutokana na makatazo ya virusi vya corona, mwaka huu sherehe hizi za Seder zitakuwa tofauti sana. Rabbi Rick Jacobs anaishi mjini New York, ambako sasa maambukizi ni mengi zaidi nchini Marekani. Yeye ni rais wa Umoja wa wayahudi Marekani Rabbi Jacobs anawashauri jinsi wanavyoweza kuungana kwa pamoja kusheherekea Pasaka ya mwaka  huu. Suluhisho moja alilosema ni kutumia simu ya video. Ujumbe wa dini utawekwa mtandaoni ili kila mmoja atajumuika kusoma. Rabbi Jacobs anawaelekeza watu dondoo za jinsi ya kutumia  simu ya video kwa uwakilishi mzuri zaidi. ""Kimila kuna wakati ambao unahitajika kufungua mlango kwa ajili ya Eliya. Mara nyingi ni vijana wadogo zaidi ndio wanafanya shughuli hiyo wakati wa maadhimisho hayo. ""Anaweza kuwa kijana mdogo zaidi huypo katika nyumba yako sasa  lakini wapo maeneo mengine ya nchi. Wanaweza kutumia simu au tablet zao na kufungua milango ya nyumba zao na kufungua. ""Lakini ukweli ni kwamba ibada hiyo itakuwa ya hisia zaidi , mtu ahisi kuwa mlango wake umefunguliwa na kupokea ukombozi. ""Tunashauri watu watumie Zoom chat na kuuliza, 'Vitu gani wanavitarajia katika maombi yao? Vitu gani wanaridhia zaidi  kuvifanya ili kuweza kuponya zaidi ulimwengu?' ""Ukombozi katika janga hili kama ilivyokuwa miaka ya mababu zetu, ndio hicho tunahitaji sasa. Historia ya wayahudi walivyopitia changamoto nyingi inawakumbusha kuwa kuna matumaini ya kukabiliana na changamoto zote."" Baadhi ya watu, mlipuko wa ugonjwa huu umewapa fursa ya kuimarisha imani zao zaidi. Carole Kutsushi ni mkristo anayeishi jijini Nairobi nchini Kenya. Wakati taifa limetangaza marufuku ya kutotoka na serikali imewataka watu wakae nyumbani, Shule zikiwa zimefungwa na rais amewataka watu wasikusanyike  hata kwenye shughuli za ibada. Carole ana watoto wawili ambaao sasa wako nyumbani  wakati wote na hali imekuwa ngumu kwa sababu ana biashara ndogo . Licha ya changamoto zilizopo, lakini bado Carole anajaribu kuwa na mtazamo chanya. Kanisa lake huwa lina sala za jumuiya ambapo kundi dogo la watu wanakutana kwa sala na huwa wanaenda kusali nyumba moja kwa kila wiki. Sasa wanafanya jumuiya hiyo kupitia mikutano ya simu na kuweza kusali kwa pamoja kwa kutumia Zoom kila Jumanne na Ijumaa. ""Nadhani ni changamoto kidogo lakini ni namna nzuri ya kuwa karibu na Mungu tukiwa nyumbani"" ""Nadhani sala hizi za simu za video zimetuweka karibu na Mungu zaidi ya ilivyokuwa awali "". Pasaka ni sherehe muhimu sana kwa wakristo, mwaka huu sherehe hiyo itaadhimishwa Aprili 12, kama ishara ya kukumbuka kifa cha Yesu msalabani na kufufuka kwa Kristo. Watu wengi huwa wanafanya jitihada maalumu za kuhudhuria misa takatifu katika kipindi hiki haswa siku ya Ijumaa Kuu na Jumapili ya Pasaka. ""Tutaadhimisha siku hii tafatifu ya Ijumaa kuu kwenye simu ya video ya Zoom,"" says Carole. ""Kwa sababu sasa hali ilivyo ni ngumu kupokea mwili wa Yesu kwa kupata sakramenti ya Komuniyo tukiwa kanisani kama ilivyokuwa kawaida lakini sasa tutatumia ishara ambayo itawasilisha tukio hilo. ""Tutachukua kipande cha mkate wa kawaida tu  na juisi ya zabibu na kuziombea na kutumia hizo kama komuniyo. Yesu anataka sisi tuonyeshe upendo kwa kujaliana"", alisema Carole. Mwezi wa Ramadhani unaanza tarehe 23, Aprili.Ni wakati ambao wanakumbuka kitabu kitakatibu cha Qur'an kilipotolewa n na mtume Muhammad. Waislamu huwa wanafunga chakula na maji wakati wa saa za mchana na kujidhatiti katika sala ili kuimarisha imani zao kuwa karibu na Mola. Kila jioni jua linapozama, familia na marafiki wanajumuika kwa pamoja kwa ajili ya kufturu. Wengi huwa wanaenda msikitini kusali. Lakini jinsi hali inavyoenda, inawezekana utaratibu huo ambao wamezoea hautaweza kufanyika tena kwa mwaka huu. Afrika Kusini imefunga nchi yake tangu Machi 26, watu wakiwa hawaruhusiwi kutoka nje labda kwa ajili ya mahitaji maalumu ya chakula na dawa. Marufuku hiyo ilikuwa idumu kwa muda wa wiki tatu lakini hali inavyoenda , marufuku itaongezeka muda. Sataar Parker ni msemaji wa msikiti mkuu nchini humo Masjidul-Quds uliopo Cape Town,wenye waumini wapatao  5,000. Yeye anasema, watatumia mitandao ya kijamii kama  YouTube na Facebook, ili kufanya maadhimisho ya mwezi mtukufu wa Ramadhani. Nchini Uingereza, kundi la vijana wa kiislamu wameamua njia ya teknolojia kuadhimisha futari hii. Kwa kawaida , waislamu huwa wanaweka tent nje n kuandaa chakula ambacho yeyote anakaribishwa kujumuika kula. Wakati huu ambao mjumuiko wa watu unakatazwa, watu watajumuika kwenye video kwa sala wakati kila mtu ameandaa futari yake akiwa peke yake au mbali na mtu mwingine .","""Kwa sababu hali hii, wanaadhimisha jioni ya siku 14, kama sherehe hili zimekuwa muhimu sana kwa waislamu.

Awali akitangaza uamuzi wa kuungana na serikali ya CCM, Katibu Mkuu wa Chama hicho ADO Shaibu alisema uamuzi huo umeridhiwa na kamati kuu ya chama hicho baada ya kutafakari kwa kina. Shaibu alisema uamuzi huo sasa pia utawawezesha Madiwani, Wajumbe wa Baraza la  Wawakilishi na Wabunge kupitia chama hicho, kuweza kushiriki kwenye vyombo vyao vya uwakilishi ili kuendeleza mapambano. Katika mkutano maalum wa kamati kuu ya chama cha ACT Wazalendo, waliamua kuwa wapendekeze jina la mwanachama atakayekuwa makamu wa kwanza wa rais wa Zanzibar. Pia ACT Wazalendo, imewaruhusu wajumbe wa baraza la wawakilishi, wabunge, na madiwani waliochaguliwa kukiwakilisha chama na wananchi waliowachagua. Miongoni mwa sababu walizotoa kufikia uamuzi huo ni pamoja na kutathmini historia ya mapambano ya demokrasia Zanzibar na Tanzania bara kwa ujumla na kusema kuwa mara nyingi  matukio ya raia kujeruhiwa, uwepo wa uhasama wa kisiasa, kudhalilishwa kijinsia na mali za watu kuharibiwa yamekuwa yakijirudia huku jambo muhimu ni kuwa na amani. Aidha, Kamati kuu  ya ACT, imeahidi kufanya mabadiliko ya mfumo wa uchaguzi Zanzibar ili kurejesha imani ya wananchi juu ya uwepo wa uchaguzi huru na wa haki. Kwa mujibu wa Chama cha ACT Wazalendo, hali ilivyo kwa sasa Zanzibar inahitaji busara kubwa katika kuponya majeraha yaliyotokana na uchaguzi huo, ili kuhakikisha kuwa matukio ya namna hiyo hayajirudii tena. Katiba ya Zanzibar inasema kuwa  Muundo wa serikali ya Mapinduzi Zanzibar utakuwa wa Umoja wa kitaifa na utendaji wa kazi zake utafanywa katika utaratibu utakaohakikisha umoja unaendelezwa nchini na lengo la kufikia demokrasia.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-50806303,"Maandamano makali yanaendelea nchini India kupinga sheria mpya juu ya wahamiaji na kusababisha mapambano makali na polisi. Mpaka sasa, takribani watu sita wamepoteza maisha kufuatia siku tano za makabiliano makali na vyombo vya usalama. Kati yao, wawili wameuawa katika jimbo la kaskazini mashariki la Assam, ambapo kwa mujibu wa maafisa usalama waliuawa baada ya mamia kukiuka marufuku ya kutotoka nje. Maelfu ya polisi na wanajeshi wamepelekwa katika maeneo ambayo watu wanaandama ili kutuliza ghasia. Huduma za mawasiliano ya intaneti pia zimezimwa ili kufanya ugumu kwa watu kuwasiliana. Mtafaruku huo unakuja siku chache tu baada ya bunge la India kupitisha mabadiliko ya sheria ya Uraia ambayo wakosoaji wanasema ni sehemu ya ajenda ya serikali kuwakandamiza Waislamu. Sheria hiyo inawapatia msamaha wahamiaji haramu ambao si Waislamu kutoka nchi tatu za jirani ambazo wasio waislamu ni wachache, nchi hizo ni Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Afghanistani. Wahamiaji hao pia wanapatiwa uraia wa India baada ya sheria kupita. Serikali ya India inaongozwa na chama cha kitaifa cha Kihindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ambacho kinadai kuwa hatua hiyo itawapatia hifadhi watu ambao wanakimbia unyanyasaji wa mateso kutokana na imani zao za dini. Maandamano hayo yamesambaa mpaka katika mji mkuu wa New Delhi, na miji ya Mumbai, Hyderabad na Kolkata. Sheria mpya inasemaje? Mabadiliko haya yanakuja kurekebisha sheria ya Uraia iliyopitishwa miaka 64 iliyopita  ambayo ilikuwa hairuhusu wahamiaji haramu kupatiwa uraia wa India. Wahamiaji haramu wanatafsiriwa kwa sheria hiyo kama wageni wanaoingia India bila kuwa na kibali sahihi cha kusafiria au wanaopitiliza muda wao wa kukaa ulioruhusiwa. Wahamiaji haramu wanaweza kufungwa gerezani au kurudishwa katika nchi zao za asili. Sheria mpya pia inarekebisha kipengele kinachosema mtu yoyote anatakiwa kuishi  India au kufanya kazi katika serikali  ya shirikisho kwa takriban miaka 11 kabla ya kuomba uraia. Sasa, kutakuwa na utofauti kwa utekelezwaji wa sheria hiyo  kwa waumini wa dini sita, ambazo ni Hindu, Singasinga, Mabudha, Jain, Parsi na Wakristo kama wanaweza kuthibitisha kuwa ni raia wa Pakistani, Adghanistani au Bangladeshi. Wao watatakiwa kuishi au kufanya kazi ndani ya India kwa muda wa miaka sita ili kuweza kuomba uraia wa India. Sheria hiyo pia inasema watu ambao wana kadi ya uraia wa India kutoka nje ya nchi (OCI) - hadhi ya uhamiaji inayomruhusu raia wan je ya India kuishi na kufanya kazi ndani ya India bila vikwazo vyovyote, wanaweza kupoteza hadhi hiyo kama wakiuka sheria  za ndani kwa makosa makubwa au madogo. Kwa nini sheria hii inaleta utata? Wapinzani wa sheria hiyo wanasema inawatenga na kwenda kinyume na kanuni za katiba. Wanasema imani haiwezi kutumika kama kipimo cha kupata uraia. Katiba inakataza ubaguzi wa dini kwa raia na inawahakikisha watu wote haki sawa kabla ya sheria  na ulinzi wa sheria. Mwanasheria kutoka mjini Delhi, Gautam Bhatia amesema: ''kwa kuwagawanyisha watu wanaodhaniwa kuwa wahamiaji katika makundi ya waislamu na wale ambao sio waislamu, sheria hii kwa dhahiri inatafuta kuingiza ubaguzi wa dini katika sheria, jambo ambalo ni la kinyume na misingi yetu ya kikatiba.'' Mwanahistoria Mukul Kesavan amesema sheria hiyo ''imesukwa katika lugha inayowalenga wahamiaji lakini lengo lake kuu ni kuwazuia waislamu kupata uraia.'' Wakosoaji wanasema imetengenezwa ikilenga kuwalinda wachache, sheria ingeyajumuisha makundi ya kiislamu ambayo yamepata manyanyaso ndani ya nchi zao kwa mfano Ahmadiya nchini Pakistani na Warohingyas ndani ya Myanmar. (Serikali imeenda mahakama kuu kutaka wakimbizi wa Rohingya waondoke nchini India.) Akiitetea sheria mpya, kiongozi wa BJP Ram Madhav amesema: ''hakuna nchi yoyote duniani inayokubali wahamiaji haramu.'' ''Sheria za uraia wa India zipo kwa yoyote yule anayelalamika. Uraia asili ni chaguo la watu walioomba uraia wa India kwa kufuata sheria. Wahamiaji wengine haramu wote watakuwa wameingia kwa njia za kujipenyeza,'' aliongeza. Pia akiitetea sheria hiyo mapema mwaka huu, mhariri wa gazeti la Swarajva, R Jagannathan aliandika: ''...kutowaweka wasilamu katika muswada huu inaendana na uhalisia kuwa nchi hizi tatu ni za kiislamu kwasabau katiba zao zinasema hivyo au kwasababu ya matendo ya majeshi ya kiislamu ambao huwataka waumini wa watu wengine kubadilisha dini au kuwanyanyasa."" Ipi historia ya sheria hii? Muswada wa marekebisho ya  sheria ya uraia uliwasilishwa bungeni kwa mara ya kwanza Julai 2016. Uliweza kupita katika bunge la chini ambapo BJP ina wawakilishi wengi zaidi, lakini ilishindwa kupitishwa katika bunge la juu, baada ya maandamano na vurugu kutokea kaskazini mashariki mwa India. Maandamano hayo yalikuwa makubwa zaidi katika jimbo la Assam, ambalo mwezi  Agosti wakaazi wake milioni mbili hawakuandikishwa kwenye daftari la raia. Uhamiaji haramu kutoka Bangladeshi umekuwa ni jambo la kuhofiwa ndani ya jimbo hilo. Sheria ya uraia imekuwa ikihusianishwa na na daftari la uraia, ingawaje ni vitu viwili tofauti. Mfumo wa kuandikisha uraia (NRC) ni orodha ya watu ambao wanaweza kuthibitisha walikuja katika jimbo hilo kufikia tarehe 24 Machi 1971, siku moja kabla ya nchi jirani ya Bangladeshi kupata uhuru. Mambo hayo mawili yana uhusiano wa karibu, kwa sababu sheria ya Uraia itasaidia kuwalinda watua ambao sio Waislamu ambao hawamo kwenye daftari la usajili la raia na wanakumbana na hatari ya kurejeshwa kwenye nchi walizotoka ama kufungwa. Hii ina maaana ya kuwa maelfu ya Wahindu wa Bengali wenye asili ya Bangladeshi ambao hawakuandikishwa kwenye daftari wanaweza kupata uraia na kuendelea kuishi kwenye jimbo la Assam. Tayari Waziri wa Mambo ya Ndani wa India Amit Shah amependekeza kusajiliwa kwa raia nchi nzima ili kuhakikisha kuwa ""kila aliyejipenyeza (mhamiaji haramu) atambuliwe na afurushwe kutoka India"" kufikia mwaka 2024. ""Kama serikali itaendelea na mipango yake ya kusajili raia nchi nzima, basi kuna watu wa makundi mawili watakaoathirika. Kundi la kwanza ni Waislamu ambao sasa wataambiwa kuwa ni wahamiaji haramu, na wengine wote waliobaki pia wataambiwa kuwa ni wahamiaji haramu. Lakini kwa hao wengine tayari kuna sheria inayowalinda kama wataweza kuonesha kuwa nchi yao ya asili ni Afghanistani, Bangladeshi na Pakistani,"" amesema bw Bhatia.","ikia tarehe 24 Machi 1971.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-59705333,"Kwa zaidi ya miezi mitatu iliyopita, kikundi cha vuguvugu la Wahingu wenye itikadi za mrengo wa kulia, katika kitongoji tajiri cha mji mku mkuu wa India Delhi kimekuwa kikiwazuwia Waislam kusali sala yao ya Ijumaa katika maeneo ya umma. Wamekuwa wakiwapigia kelele na kuwataka waache kusali katika maeneo ya wazi. Waislamu wanaofanya kazi katika maeneo bali mbali wamekuwa wakitumia maeneo ya wazi kama vile  kwenye masoko, viwandani na katika ofisi za serikali, ardhi za watu binafsi na kwingineko kusali kwa miaka mingi, lakini sasa mambo yamebadilika. Watu wanawapigia kelele wakiwatukana na kuwaambia waondoke wanataka kuegesha magari yao namaenno mengine ya ukatili kuwazuwia Waislamu wasiingie kwenye maeno hayo. Wakati mwingine , huwaita Waislamu Jihadi na Wapakistan. Hali hiyo imefanya sasa sala za Waislam kufanyika chini ya ulinzi wa polisi. Altaf Ahmed, ambaye ni muasisi mwenza wa kikundi cha kijamii cha Waislam cha -  Gurgaon Muslim Council, anasema, ""Hali ya kutisha imeongezeka. Hatukuwahi kufikiria kuwa inaweza hii inaweza kutokea katika eneo letu la Gurgaon."" Sehemu yam ji wa Gurgaon, uliopo takriban maili 15 kutoka mji wa Delhi, ni eneo lililostawi san ana ukuaji huu umejitiokeza katika kipindi cha chini ya miaka miwili pekee. Serikali imeuita ""Mji wa Milenia"" - unaokaliwa na watu zaidi ya milioni moja. Lakini katika mji wa  Gurgaon, utata mpya umeanza kuongezeka kuhusu sala. ""Hatupingi Waislam au sala. Lakini ibada katika maeneo ya wazi ni   'jihadi ya ardhi',"" alisema  Kulbhushan Bharadwaj, mmoja wa viongozi wa kikundi cha dhehebu la Hindu kinachopiga sala ya Waislamu. Viongozi wa  kiislam wanasema tetesi za hivi karibuni zinahusu   ""ardhi ambayo Waislamu wanaitumia kuomba au wanapanga kuitwaa"". Miaka ya nyuma, Wahindu wanaopigania utaifa, walianzisha vuguvugu dhidi ya   ""mapenzi ya jihadi"" lililowalenga Waislamu. Mapenzi ya jihadi  au Love jihad  ilikuwa ni dhana potofu ambayo iliwashutumu wanaume wa Kiislamu kuwaowa wanawake Wahindu na kuwaingiza kwa lazima katika Uislamu na kuwachinja ng'ombe. Waandamanaji wanadai kuwa kulikuwa na sehemu ya muungano wa mashirika kumi na mawili ya Wahindu wanaopigania utaifa takribankumi na mawili. Shirika hilo  linajumuisha vijana wadogo, wanaume wasio na ajira-wanaoitwa Sammilita Hindu Sangharsh Samiti. ""Hatupendi Waislamu kusali karibu na nyumba yangu. Tunaogopa. Baada ya sala, wanatembea tembea,""  alisema Sunil Yadav, mkazi wa mji huo.  Alijiunga na maandamano ya kuzuwia sala katika eneo moja la ardhi yenye ukubwa wa heka 36 iliyopo karibu na nyumba yake. Wiki iliyopita kiongozi wa chama cha kisiasa cha India   BJP  Haryana - mwenye cheo cha Waziri katika jimbo uliopo mji wa   Gurgaon - aliwalaani hadharani Waislamu kwa kufanya ibada. Katika mwaka 2017, maandamano ya awali dhidi ya sala ya Waislamu katika maeneo ya wazi yalianza na kufuatia mazungumzo, makundi ya kiraia ya Waislamu yalikubali kupunguza maeneo wanayofanya ibada yao kutoka maeneo 108 hadi 36. Lakini mwaka huu maandamano yamechukua mkono mpya . Hatahivyo,sababu juu ya maandamano haya bado haiku wazi. Waislamu katika mji wa Gurgaon wamekuwa wakifanya sala katika maeneo ya wazi  kwa zaidi ya karne mbili. Tatizo kuu ni kwamba hawana maeneo ya kutosha kwa ajili ya waumini wao. ""Wanawaambia Waislamu kwenda msikiti  na kuomba huko. tatizo ni kwamba hakuna misikiti ya kutosha  ."" Kuna takriban misikiti 13 katika mji wa  Gurgaon, ambapo mmoja wapo uko mbali na sehemu mpya ya mji. Lakini wengi wa wahamiaji wanaishi na kufanya kazi katika sehemu hii mpya. Miaka mitano iliyopita, waislamu wawili walishindwa katika juhudi za kuitaka serikali iwapatie ardhi zilizouzwa kwa ajili ya malengo ya kidini. Kile kinachotokea katika Gurgaon kinakumbusha marufuku iliyowekwa kwa Waislamu kusali katika mitaa ya mji wa Paris Ufaransa  mwaka  2011 , ambapo maeneo ya sala yalidungwa kutokana na maandamano ya waandamanaji wa mrengo wa kulia. Hatahivyo,  sera ya India ya   upendeleo wa dini za walio wengi imekabiliwa na tisho kwa miaka ya hivi karibuni.. Lakini bado, katika Gurgaon, mambo hayajabadilika. Kulingana na utafiti mpya wa kituo cha dini cha India, Wahindi wengi  wanasema, ni muhimu kuheshimu dini zote ili kuwa  ""Wahindi halisi''. Kwa sasa Waislamu wa Gurgaon wako katika hali ya kutokuwa na uhakika na wasiwasi. ""Tunaogopa na kudhalilishwa kila mara ,"" alisema  Ahmed said.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-60426989,"Mwenyekiti wa chama cha upinzani Tanzania Chadema Freeman Mbowe na wenzake watatu wana kesi ya kujibu . Mahakama Kuu Divisheni ya Makosa ya Rushwa na Uhujumu Uchumi imesema Mbowe na wenzake watatu ambao walikuwa wanajeshi wa jeshi la wananchi wa Tanzania (JWTZ), Mohamed Ling'wenya, Halfan Bwire na Adam Kasekwa wana kesi ya kujibu kuhusiana na tuhuma mbalimbali zikiwemo za kupanga njama za kufanya vitendo vya kigaidi. Upande wa Jamhuri ulikamilisha kuwasilisha ushahidi wake wiki hii kupitia mashahidi wake 13 kati ya 24 waliotarajiwa kutoa ushahidi Mahakamani. Sehemu kubwa ya mashahidi hao 13 ni maafisa kutoka Jeshi la Polisi. Tangu kuanza kusikilizwa kwa kesi hiyo namba 16/2021, kwenye Mahakama kuu divisheni ya makosa ya rushwa na uhujumu uchumi, makundi ya wafuasi wa chama chake wamekuwa wakifika ndani na nje ya mahakama kufuatilia, huku ulinzi mkubwa ukiimarishwa wakati wote. Mbowe alikamatwa pamoja na wafuasi wengine wa Chadema jijini Mwanza usiku wa kuamkia Julai 21, 2021 siku ambayo kulikua kufanyike kongamano kubwa la kudai katiba mpya lililoandaliwa na Baraza la Vijana wa Chadema (Bavicha). Siku chache kabla ya kukamatwa kwake, Polisi jijini Mwanza ilitangaza kuzuia kufanyika kwa kongamano hilo kwa sababu za kiusalama, lakini Mbowe alijitokeza mbele ya waandishi wa habari na kutangaza kwamba kongamano hilo lipo pale pale na litafanyika kama ilivyopangwa licha ya zuio hilo la Polisi. ""Kama polisi wanataka kutuzuia wajiandae kufanya hivyo wakiwa tayari kutukamata viongozi na wanachama wote kwa sababu sote hatutaondoka Mwanza hadi tufanye kongamano la Katiba mpya,"" alisisitiza Mbowe katika mkutano huo na wanahabari. Wafuasi wengine zaidi ya 10 waliokamatwa pamoja na Mbowe jijini Mwanza waliachiliwa huru na jeshi la polisi, ambapo Mbowe aliendelea kushikiliwa kabla ya kuunganishwa na wanaodaiwa kuwa walinzi wake kwenye kesi inayoendelea sasa ya ugaidi. Katika kesi hiyo Mbowe anadaiwa kula njama ya kutenda kosa la ugaidi kati ya Mei na Agosti mwaka 2020 akiwa katika Hoteli ya Aishi Mkoani Kilimanjaro, kosa la pili la Mbowe ni kutoa fedha kwa ajili ya kufadhili ugaidi kinyume cha sheria ya ugaidi kati ya tarehe hizo tajwa. Kiongozi huyu mkuu wa Chadema alitiwa mbaroni huko jijini Mwanza usiku wa kuamkia tarehe 21 mwezi Julai, 2021. Chama chake cha Chadema, kiliwataka wafuasi wa chama hicho kuingia mtaani kumtafuta baada ya juhudi zake za kumtafuta kukwama na hawajui walipo, baada ya Mamlaka kutosema lolote kwa muda kuhusu kukamatwa kwa Mbowe. Baadae Polisi walikuja kuthibitisha kumkamatwa na kwamba amesafirshwa kutoka Mwanza kwenda Dar es Salaam na kuunganishwa kwenye kesi ya ugaidi. Taarifa ya Msemaji wa Polisi, David Misime ilisema kuwa Mbowe hakukamatwa kwa tuhuma za kupanga na kuandaa kongamano la Katiba mpya jijini Mwanza bali alifahamu tuhuma zinazomkabili. Mbowe alifikishwa katika Mahakama ya Hakimu Mkazi Kisutu kwa mara ya kwanza Julai 26, 2021 na kusomewa mashtaka mawili ikiwemo la ugaidi. Baada ya kusomewa maelezo Mbowe hakutakiwa kujibu chochote kwa kuwa Mahakama hiyo haina mamlaka, kesi ikahairishwa hadi Agosti 5, 2021 kusubiri nyaraka ili ihamishiwe Mahakama kuu. Mbowe ambaye ni kiongozi wa zamani wa Kambi Rasmi ya Upinzani Bungeni (KUB) na wenzake watatu walisomewa mashtaka sita yakiwemo ya kufadhili vitendo vya ugaidi na kukusanya pesa kwa kufanya vitendo hivyo. Mashtaka mengine ni kukusanya fedha kwa ajili ya kufanya vitendo vya kigaidi, kukutwa na silaha aina ya bastola na kukutwa na sare za jeshi kinyume cha sheria. Kati ya mashtaka hayo sita, Mbowe anakabiliwa na mashtaka mawili ambayo ni kula njama na kufadhili vitendo vya kigaidi. Rais wa Tanzania Samia Suluhu Hassan licha ya kusema hawezi kuzungumzia zaidi kesi ya Mbowe kwa kuwa iko Mahakamani, aliiambia BBC kuwa mashtaka dhidi ya kiongozi huyo wa Upinzani hayakuchochewa kwa sababu za kisiasa. Pamoja na mengine kauli yake hiyo iliibua mjadala mzito kwa wafuatiliaji wa kesi hiyo na siasa za Tanzania kwa ujumla. Kesi hii ilianza kusikilizwa kwenye Mahakama kuu ya Makosa ya Rushwa na Uhujumu Uchumi ikitokea Mahakama ya Hakimu mkazi Kisutu ambayo haikuwa na mamlaka ya kusikiliza kisheria. Jaji Elinaza Luvanda alijitoa kusikiliza kesi hiyo kufuatia maombi ya Mbowi, kwa niaba ya washitakiwa wenzake kudai kuwa hawana Imani na Jaji huyo kama atatenda haki. Nafasi yake akapangiwa Jaji Mustapha Siyani. Jaji Mustapha Siyani alikuwa jaji wa pili kujitoa kusikiliza kesi hiyo kufuatia kuteuliwa kwake kuwa Jaji kiongozi. Jaji Joachim Tiganga akachukua nafasi yake Ushahidi umefungwa Wiki hii Februari 13, 2021 kwa mashahidi 13 wa upande wa mashtaka kumaliza kutoa ushahidi wao. Kinachosubiriwa sasa ni uamuzi wa Mahakama Kuu hiyo kuamua leo kama Mbowe na wenzie wana kesi ya kujibu ama la.","'The Chadema party's upinzani cell, Freeman Mbowe and his three associates, have been charged.

Silaha hizi  ni tata kwasababu husababisha uharibifu mkubwa zaidi kuliko vilipuzi vinavyofahamika vyenye ukubwa  sawa na wake, na vina athari mbaya kwa yeyote atakayejipata kwenyeeneo la mlipuko wake. Bumu la  vacuum, ambalo pia linaitwa  bomu la aerosol  au kilipuzi cha anga cha mafuta, huwa limeundwa kwa kontena ya mafuta pamoja na vifyatuzi viwili  zilizotenganishwa  vya  vilipuzi. Bomu hili linaweza kufyatuliwa kama roketi au kudondoshwa kama bomu kutoka kwenye ndege . Wakati linapopiga eneo, kifyatuzi cha kilipuzi hufungua kontena na mchanganyiko mkubwa wa mafuta husambaa kama wingu. Wingu hili linaweza kupenya kweney mianya yoyote wazi ya jengo au  maeneo yaliyolindwa kabisa ambayo yamezibwa kabisa. Kisha kifyatuzi kingine hulipua wingu hil, na kusababisha moto mkubwa, wimbi kubwa la  mlipuko na   vacuum ambayo hufyonza oksijeni yote inayozingira iliyopo katika eneo zima. Silaha hiyo inaweza kuharibu majengo, vifaa na kuua au kuwajeruhi watu. Mabomu haya hutumiwa kwa malengo mbali mbali na hutengenezwa katika ukubwa  tofauti - ikiwa ni Pamoja na silaha kwa ajili ya matumizi ya mwanajeshi binafsi kama vile gurunadi na  vilipuzi vinavyolipuliwa kwa mkono. Mabomu haya makubwa yanayofyatuliwa kutoka kwenye ndege pia yametengenezwa, kwa ajili hasa ya kuua wanajeshi au wanaojilinda kwenye mapango na katika mahandaki - athari za silaha hizi huwa mbaya zai katika maeneo yaliyofungwa. Katika mwaka 2007, Urusi ilifanya majaribio makubwa zaidi ya silaha za Thermobaric, ambazo pia zinaitwa ''Father of all bombs'' (Baba wa mabomu yote) . Ilitengeneza kilipuzi chenye ukubwa wa tani 44 za bomu la kawaida - na kulifanya kuwa kifaa kikubwa zaidi cha kulipua bomu lisilo la nyuklia duniani. Kutokana na ubaya wa athari zake, na jinsi yanavyosaidia kujilinda dhidi  ya wapinzani ambao huchimba mahandaki ndani ya majengo au  mapango ya maficho, mabomu ya vacuum yamekuwa yakitumika katika mazingira ya mijini. Mabomu haya ni muhimu kutokana na kile kinachoendelea nchini Ukraine, ambako vikosi vya Urusi yanajaribu kuchukua udhibiti wa mji mkuu, Kyiv, na miji mingine muhimu iliyopo mashariki mwa nchi. Balozi wa Ukraine katika Umoja wa Mataifa Oksana Markarova, ameishutumu Urusi kwa kutumia bomu katika katika uvamizi wake. Hatahivyo, hakuna uthibitisho rasmi wa madai haya. Pia kumeripowa na ripoti za kuonekana kwa vilipuzi vya  roketi za thermobaric  nchini  Ukraine katika kipindi cha siku chache zilizopita. Hakunna sheria za kimataifa zinazozuwia matumizi yake, lakini kama nchi inayatumia kuwalenga raia katika makazi ya watu, shule au hospitali , basi inaweza kupatikana na hatia ya uhalifu wa kivita chini ya mkataba wa Heague wa mwaka 2899 na 1907. Mwendesha mashitaka mkuu wa mahakama ya kimataifa ya uhalifu  Karim Khan amesema kuwa mahakama yake itachunguza uwezekano wa kutekelezwa kwa uhalifu wa kivita katika Ukraine. Silaha za Thermobaric zilitumika katika Vita ya pili ya dunia , wakati zilipotumiwa kwa mara ya kwanza na jeshi la Ujerumani. Hazikutengenezwa katika maeneo mengi duniani hadi ilipofika miaka ya 1960, wakati Marekani ilipozitumia katika vita vya Vietnam. Marekani pia iliyatumia katika mwaka 2001 kujaribu kuangamiza maficho ya vikosi vya al-Qaeda forces katika mapango ya milima ya  Tora Bora nchini  Afghanistan. Urusi iliyatumia katika vita vya Chechnya katika mwaka 199 na ililaaniwa na shirika la kutete haki za binadamu  la  Human Rights Watch kwa kufanya hivyo.

Baadhi ya maneno ambayo Mugabe aliyowahi kuyasema dhidi ya bara la ulaya kuhusua nchi yake. ""Zimbabwe ni huru kwa sababu watu wake wako huru na watu wake wanapaswa kuwa huru daima"" ""Sisi sio watu wa ulaya, hatujawahi kuomba hata sehemu ndogo ya ulaya, Blair kaa na Uingereza yako na mimi niache nibaki na Zimbabwe yangu"" Awali Mugabe alisifiwa kwa  kupanua sekta ya afya  na elimu  kwa weusi walio wengi,  baadaye alitumia ghasia  dhidi ya wapinzani wake  na kuongoza uchumi wa taifa hilo ulioanguka vibaya. ""Hawawezi kuanzisha demmokrasia hapa, sisi tumeanzisha demokrasia"" ""Hii ni ardhi ya mtu mweusi hivyo ni mtu mweusi ndio ana haki ya kuamua nani akae na nani asikae"" ""Tuna ardhi yetu na katika ardhi yetu ndio tutapata fedha"" Kimataifa  mpiganaji huyo wa zamani  alionekana kama dikteta  kufuatia hatua ya jeshi lake kuwashambulia wapinzani wake mbali na kunyakuwa ardhi  kutoka kwa wakulima wachache weupe  ili kupiga jeki umaarufu wake miongoni mwa wapiga kura. Uongozi wake umezua mjadala mkubwa tangu kifo chake. Alikuwa maarufu miongoni mwa wapiga kura wengi hata katika kipindi chake cha hivi karibuni alipong'atuliwa mamlakani. Aliondolewa mamlakani alipomfuta kazi makamu wake wa rais  Emmerson Mnangagwa ambaye baadaye alikuwa rais wa taifa hilo. Rais Emmerson Mnangagwana amempongeza Mugabe tangu habari za kifo chake zianze kutolewa. Bwana Mnangagwa  alisema kwamba chama tawala Zanu -PF kilimpatia hadhi ya ushujaa wa taifa aliyohitaji. Hivi karibuni kuna madai kutoka upinzanini yalidai kuwa maisha ya Zimbabwe sasa ni magumu zaidi hata yalivyokuwa wakati wa utawala wa Robert Mugabe (hiyo ni kwa mujibu wa Fadzayi Mahere wa chama cha upinzani cha MDC). Upande wa upinzani nchini Zimbabwe umewataka watu waandamane juu ya hali mbaya ya kiuchumi katika taifa hilo, serikali imeshutumiwa kwa kushindwa kufanya kazi yake. Tangu mwaka 2017, Zimbabwe imekuwa chini ya utawala wa rais Emmerson Mnangagwa, baada ya jeshi kumuondoa kwa Robert Mugabe baada ya kutawala kwa kipindi cha muda mrefu . Tumepima utofauti huo kwa kuangalia viashiria vya uchumi vya taifa vya maisha ya raia wa Zimbabwe kuwa wako kwenye hali mbaya sasa zaidi ya walivyokuwa kabla ya Mnangagwa kuingia madarakani. Hii inaweza kuchukuliwa kama ufinyu wa ajira na mishahara kwani biashara imekuwa ya mashindano katika nyakati ngumu za kiuchumi. Licha ya takwimu iliyokadiriwa ya mwaka 2019 iko chini kidogo ya ile ya 2017, amabayo ndio ilikuwa mwaka wa mwisho madarakani wa raisi Mugabe. Pamoja na kuwa raia wa Zimbabwe wanaweza kuwa wanakabiliana na changamoto ya kushuka kwa takwimu hiyo ya hivi karibuni, si rahisi kujadili takwimu kutokana na hali kuwa mbaya zaidi hivi leo kuliko ya uongozi uliopita. Hata hivyo, hatua nyingine muhimu haina budi kuchukuliwa juu ya hali ya uchumi ambayo ni hatua nyingine ya uwekezaji katika biashara. Hakuna muda uliotangazwa kuhusu mazishi yake , huku mamlaka nchini Singapore  ikishirikina na ubalozi wa Zimbabwe kuusafarisha mwili wake nyumbani. Mugabe alikuwa akipokea matibabu nchini Singapore  tangu mwezi Aprili. Siku tatu za maombolezi ya kataifa zimeanza Zimbabwe  kufuatia kifo cha aliyekuwa rais wa taifa hilo Robert Mugabe. Mugabe ambaye ndio rais wa kwanza wa taifa hilo aliongoza taifa hilo  hadi alipopinduliwa na jeshi 2017. Licha ya kupinduliwa kwake , chama tawala Zanu- PF  kimemtangaza kuwa shujaa wa kitaifa. Mwaka 1980, Bw Mugabe alishinda uchaguzi na kuwa waziri mkuu Mwaka 1982 aliushutumu upinzani kwa kujaribu kupindua serikali Maelfu ya watu waliuawa  alipolituma jeshi lake lililopata mafunzo Korea Kaskizini, kuwakandamiza  maadui zake Mwaka 1987,alibadilisha katiba ili imruhusu kuwa rais na kuongeza mamlaka  yake Uchumi ulidororeka baada ya mwaka 2000… Wakati Mugabe aliagiza kunyakua  mashamba yaliomilikiwa na watu weupe yaliyokuwa kinara ya uchumi Mfumuko wa bei ulipelekea sarufi ya taifa kuwa bila thamani na hali nchini humo ikazidi kudororeka Baada ya uchaguzi wa mwaka 2008, Mugabe alilazimika kugawanya mamlaka na kiongozi wa upinzani Morgan Tsvangirai Japo kulikuwa na ghasia dhidi ya wafuasi wa Bw Tsvangirai katika kampeni za uchaguzi Ndoa yake na Grace Mugabe ,anayemzidi kwa maika 40, yaweza kuwa iliyomponza.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-53149948,"Wanaume ambao wamewahi kupata maambukizi ya virusi vya corona wanatakiwa kuchangia utegili wao (plasma) au majimaji yanayobaki kwenye damu baada ya kuondolewa kwa seli za damu ili uweze kutumika katika utafiti wa tiba ya ugonjwa wa Covid-19. Utafiti unaonesha kuwa wanaume wako katika hatari ya kuwa wagonjwa zaidi na hivyo basi ndio wenye kiwango kikubwa cha kinga ya mwili kuliko wanawake. Hii inamaanisha, plasma yaani utegili unaweza kuwa na umuhimu mkubwa kwenye kuokoa maisha ya walioambukizwa virusi vya corona. Shirika la huduma za utoaji damu na viungo vya upandikizaji Uingereza limesema kuwa utegili unaweza kutumika kutibu wagonjwa wa corona walio hospitali ikiwa majaribio yanayoendelea yatafanikiwa. Shirika hilo lilianza kuomba watu waliopona virusi vya corona kuchangia damu na utegili (plasma) kuanzia Aprili na kufikia katikati ya Mei, karibia watu 600 walikuwa wamechangia kwa kutoa utegili wao. Wanaume waliochangia, asilimia 43 walikuwa na kiwango cha juu cha kinga ya mwili na kutumika katika majaribio, ikilinganishwa na asilimia 29 tu ya wanawake. Kiwango cha juu cha kinga ya mwili mara nyingi kilikuwa ni kwa wagonjwa watu wazima, wagojwa wa Asia pamoja na wale ambao walishawahi kutibiwa ugonjwa wa virusi vya corona. ""Bado tungependa kusikia maoni ya yeyote ambaye alipata maambukizi ya virusi vya corona au kuwa na dalili za ugonjwa huo,"" Profesa David Roberts, kutoka shirika la uchangiaji damu na viungo Uingereza amesema. ""Watu wengi zaidi wanahitajika kuchangia utegili (plasma). ""Lakini hasa tungependa ikiwa wanaume wengi zaidi wangejitokeza."" Sio kila mmoja anaweza kuchangia majimaji yake ya kwenye damu (plasma). 'Kuchagia hakuchukui muda' Simon Callon, 51, kutoka hospitali ya Helens, Merseyside, alichangia utegili wake baada ya kuanza kuugua virusi vya corona kisha akampoteza baba yake, Noel, kwa ugonjwa wa Covid-19. ""Haikuchukua muda,"" anasema, ""na ni rahisi sana."" Simon hakuwa anakohoa wakati ameambukizwa lakini alikuwa anaumwa na kichwa kweli na kutetemeka usiku kwa siku kadhaa. Alifanikiwa kupimwa kwasababu mchumba wake anafanyakazi katika wizara ya afya. Wiki kadhaa baadae, baba yake alianza kuugua na kulazwa hospitali huku kiwango chake cha oksijeni kikiwa chini lakini hakupona. ""Sitaki mwengine yeyote apitie alichopitia baba yangu,"" Simon anasema. ""Alikufa hospitali bila familia wala rafiki zaidi ya wauguzi waliokuwa wamemshika mkono. ""Watu 10 ndio walioruhusiwa kuhudhuria mazishi yake. ""Unapoweza kumsaidia mtu au kunusuru maisha ya mwengine, msaidie."" Utegili (plasma) au majimaji ya damu ni nini? Ni majimaji ya rangi ya njano ambayo huchangia karibia nusu ya idadi ya damu na yana seli nyekundu na nyeupe za damu na chembe za kugandisha damu (platelets) kote mwilini. Baada ya mtu kuambikizwa virusi, utegili una kinga ya mwili inayotumika kukabiliana na maambukizi. Kingamiwli yenye utegili inaundwa wakati mtu amepona maambukizi ya virusi vya corona, na kawaida huwa ni siku 28 baada ya kupona. Kwanini ni muhimu? Kinga mwili hii inaweza kupewa wagonjwa wa Covid-19 kwa kupitia mishipa kama ilivyo mtu anapotiwa damu kumsaidia kukabiliana na virusi vya corona na kuimarisha uwezo wa kupona.

Matumizi ya ununuzi wa silaha uliofanywa na China uliongezeka kwa mara 26 . Mwaka 2017 Marekani ilitumia asilimia 3.1 ya mapato yake kununua silaha ikiwa ni robo ya matumizi ya taifa lililotumia fedha nyingi zaidi kununua silaha kulingana na SIPRI. Kutokana na hilo ni wazi kwamba , Washington haipo katika mataifa 20 ambayo hutumia utajiri wao kununua silaha za kijeshi. Hizi hapa nchi 10 ambazo zinaongoza katika orodha hiyo. Bahrain ilitawaliwa na ufalme wa Madhehebu ya sunni lakini wengi wa raia wake  ni Wislamu wa madhehebu ya Shiite , suala ambalo limekuwa likizua hali ya wasiwasi katika taifa hilo. Mwaka 2011 , wakati wa mapinduzi ya Arabuni au Arab Uprising, wanajeshi wa baraza la Ghuba  walipelekwa katika taifa hilo  kuzuia maandamano. Mwaka 2017 taifa hilo lilitenga $ 1,396m katika matumizi yake katika sekta ya ulinzi  ikiwa ni asilimia 4.1 ya mapato yake  kulingana na makadirio ya Sipri.

Kulingana na Siemon Wezeman, mchunguzi mkuu katika taasisi ya SIPRI , punguzo hilo linatokana na matatizo ya kiuchumi ambayo taifa hilo limekuwa likishuhudia tangu 2014 , kwasababu kuliimarisha jeshi lake kufikia viwango vya kisasa kumekuwa kipao mbele cha Moscow..

Hali hiyo ilirekebishwa baada ya kusainiwa kwa  makubaliano ya amani na Misri 1979 na Jordan 1994. Hatahivyo taifa hilo bado linaendelea kuwa na maadui hususan katika mpaka wake na Syria pamoja na wapiganaji wa Lebanon wa Hezbollah ambao ni washirika wa Iran, mojawapo ya mataifa ambayo hayaonani macho kwa macho na Israel.

Taifa la Algeria limekumbwa na vipindi vikali vya ghasia katika historia yake kama taifa huru ambavyo vilianza 1962. Baadhi ya vipindi hivi vimetokana na hali ya wasiwasi kati ya makundi ya kidini na yale ya kidunia ya jamii yake. Kati ya 1992 na1998, taifa hilo lilikumbwa na mzozo wa ndani kwa ndani ambao ulisababisha zaidi ya vifo 100,000 baada ya kufutiliwa mbali kwa uchaguzi ambapo kundi la Islamic Salvation lilionekana kana kwamba litaibuka mshindi. Tangu wakati huo , taifa hilo limeendelea kuathiriwa na  ghasia za Kiislamu , lakini pia limekumbwa na mashambulio kutoka kwa makundi ya wapiganaji kama vile lile la Al Qaeda kutoka Islamic Maghreb.

Tangu 2015, serikali ya Saudia imeongoza kundi la mataifa katika vita vya Yemen  dhidi ya waasi wa Houthi ambao wanaungwa mkono na Iran. Tukio hilo ni mojawapo ya baadhi ambapo Riyadh na Tehran zinapigania udhibiti wa kisiasa, na kiuchumi wa eneo zima la mashariki ya kati .

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/56506324,"Rais mpya wa Tanzania Samia Suluhu Hassan ameanza kutoa majibu ya maswali magumu ambayo yanawatawala wananchi wake tangu alipoapishwa kushika wadhifu huo kuchukua nafasi ya Dkt. John Pombe Magufuli aliyefariki dunia tarehe 17 Machi mwaka huu wa 2021 katika Hospitali ya Mzena Dar es salaam na kuacha simanzi kubwa miongoni wa wananchi wa Taifa hilo la Afrika mashariki. Duru za kisiasa zinabainisha kuwa baada ya kutoa hotuba mbili, ya kuapishwa kwake Ikulu jijini Dar es salaam tarehe 19 Machi na ile ya kumuaga Rais Magufuli jijini Dodoma tarehe 22 Machi mwaka huu zimeonesha ujumbe wa uimara wake, matumaini na mwelekeo mpya katika kustawishi Taifa hilo. Hotuba zote mbili zimebeba ujumbe mzito kwenda kwa wanasiasa wa ndani ya chama tawala CCM na upinzani, viongozi wastaafu wakiwemo marais, uhusiano wa nchi hiyo na jirani zake, uhusiano na viongozi na nchi za kimataifa, msimamo thabiti wa Tanzania, kufuata nyayo za mtangulizi wake katika maendeleo na kusisitiza umoja na mshikamano miongoni mwa wananchi na viongozi wao. Kabla ya hotuba hizo Watanzania walikuwa wakijiuliza maswali kadhaa yakiwemo rais Samia Suluhu ataanza na nini katika uongozi wake? Ni mambo gani ambayo yatakuwa kipaumbele katika uongozi wake? Uongozi wa rais mpya utakuwa wa namna gani? Je, ataweza kuendeleza mambo yaliyoanzishwa na mtangulizi wake? Rais mpya ataleta matumaini au wasiwasi kwa Watanzania? Na zaidi hotuba zake kwa sasa zinatuma ujumbe gani kwa wananchi wake,viongozi na Jumuiya ya Kimataifa? Akiwa amepokea pongezi kutoka kwa viongozi wa nchi mbalimbali barani Afrika, pamoja na wengine kutoka bara la Asia, Amerika kusini na kaskazini, rais Samia Suluhu ametuma ujumbe kwao kuwa serikali yake itasimamia kwa umakini suala la uhusiano nao na kuwa chachu ya kujenga jamii bora baina ya mataifa hayo. ""Kwa jirani zetu na marafiki zetu niwahakikishie tutaulipa wema mliotuonesha kwa kuimarisha na kushamirisha uhusiano wetu nanyi,"" alisema Rais Suluhu katika hotuba yake ya kumuaga Magufuli mkoani Dodoma. Huu ni ujumbe muhimu na wenye kwa mataifa yote yanayoizunguka Tanzania yakiwemo Burundi,Malawi,Msumbiji,Comoro,Rwanda,Uganda, Kenya pamoja na wale waliohudhuria kuagwa Rais Magufuli kutoka nchi za Zimbabwe, Namibia, Afrika kusini, Zambia, Botswana na Angola kuwa rais mpya anatarajia kujenga uhusiano mwema kati yake na majirani zake. Pia ujumbe huo unaleta majibu ya swali la mustakabali wa Kidiplomasia wa Tanzania na Jumuiya ya kimataifa. Kwamba Rais amethibitisha kuwa yupo tayari kushirikiana na Jumuiya ya Kimataifa kwa kuwaita ""Marafiki zetu"" ikiwa na maana ya kuwakaribisha katika mashauriano ya Kidiplomasia na kuwahakikishia ushirikiano madhubuti. Katika kipindi cha Rais Magufuli ilishuhudiwa uhusiano kati ya Tanzania na Kenya ukiingia dosari mara kwa mara kutokana na nchi hizo 'kutopikika' chungu kimoja. Matukio kadhaa yaliyotokea kati ya Tanzania na Kenya yanathibitisha hali ilivyokuwa, mfano serikali ya Kenya kuzuia na kutangaza mahindi kutoka Tanzania yana sumu. Pia serikali ya Tanzania kuchoma moto vifaranga kutoka Kenya pamoja na kuzuia malori ya mahindi yaliyotoka nchini Zambia. Rais Samia ametoa ujumbe kwao kuimarisha ushirikiano mwema na majirani ikiwa na maana kuondoa 'wingu jeusi' la uhusiano baina ya nchi yake na Kenya. Miongoni mwa wasiwasi uliotawala ni mwelekeo wa kiongozi huyo mpya katika kutekeleza majukumu,ahadi na mipango iliyokuwa ikisimamiwa na mtangulizi wake. Hata hivyo kiongozi huyo ametuma ujumbe wa kuwaondoa wasiwasi raia wake. Rais huyo katika hotuba yake ya Dodoma alisema, ""Magufuli amemaliza kazi iliyomleta duniani kazi hiyo ilikuwa ni kutuonesha namna kazi zinavyofanywa, namna ya kutekeleza na kuchukua maamuzi magumu kwa masilahi ya Taifa. Nasi hatuna budi kufuata njia hii aliyotuachia,"" Serikali ya Tanzania imekuwa kwenye mikakati ya kuboresha huduma za jamii, ujenzi wa miundo mbinu mbalimbali,miradi ya maendeleo pamoja na sera zake za kiuchumi, mambo ambayo rais mpya amesisitiza kufuata nyayo za mtangulizi wake kwa masilahi ya taifa hilo. ""Nitumie fursa kwa mara nyingine nisisitize kuwa hakuna jambo ambalo litakaloharibika. Nchi yetu iko katika mikono salama mimi na mwenzangu Dk Hussein Mwinyi (Rais wa Zanzibar) tutaendeleza alipoishia na tutafika pale alipopatamani,"" Matamshi hayo ya Rais Samia yanafanana na yale aliyoyasema rais mstaafu wa awamu ya nne Jakaya Kikwete alipohojiwa na vyombo vya habari hivi karibuni kuelezea kifo cha Rais Magufuli, ambapo alisema Tanzania ipo kwenye mikono salama na Rais mpya anafahamu malengo na mipango ya miaka mitano na maelekezo ya nini kinachopaswa kufanyika kuikamilisha. Naye Katibu Mkuu wa chama cha ACT Wazalendo, Ado Shaibu ameonesha kukubaliana na hoja za Rais mpya ambapo amemwambia mwandishi wa makala haya, ""Rais Samia Suluhu alikuwa anatoa uhakika kwa wale wenye wasiwasi kuwa yale mazuri yaliyofanyika enzi za Rais Magufuli hayataendelezwa. Lakini ukichambua hotuba ya Dodoma sambamba na ile ya siku ya kuapishwa Ikulu, ni dhahiri kuwa kuna masuala ya enzi ya Rais Magufuli yatabadilishwa. Hiyo ndiyo tafsiri yangu ya wito wa Mama Samia kuwa tusahau yaliyopita,"" Kiongozi huyo ameonesha kuwa na msimamo thabiti baada ya kutoa matamshi yanayotoa ujumbe kuwa hatakuwa tayari kuyumbishwa na kuvumilia mtu yeyote itakayomkwamisha au namna yoyote ile ya kujaribu kuvuruga urais wake. Msimamo thabiti wa kiongozi huyo unapatikana katika hotuba ya kumuaga Rais Magufuli jijini Dodoma ambapo alisema, ""Wale ambao wana mashaka mwanamke huyo ataweza kuwa Rais wa Jmahuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania,nataka niwaambie aliyesimama hapa ni Rais. Nataka nirudie kwamba aliyesimama hapa ni Rais wa Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania,"" Msimamo huo unakumbusha ule wa mtangulizi wake ambaye amewahi kutoa matamshi thabiti akiwa katika moja ya mikutano yake ya hadhara mkoani Singida mwaka 2017 ambapo alisema yeye ndiye rais wa Tanzania, hayumbishwi wala kutishwa kwa jambo lolote. Aidha Magufuli amewahi kutoa kauli kuwa hakwenda Ikulu kutafuta wachumba bali kufanya kazi na 'yeye ndiye rais' anayesimamia ustawi wa nchi. Mfanano wa kauli mbili hizo za Samia Suluhu na John Magufuli zinaonesha ni viongozi wenye misimamo na wametuma ujumbe kwa wasaidizi wao, washindani wa kisiasa pamoja na wananchi kwa ujumla kuwa wanaongozwa na watu wenye uelewa na kutambua madhumuni ya Taifa na matamanio ya wananchi. Hivyo ili kutimiza majukumu yake lazima atoe ujumbe kuwa ni mwenye msimamo usiotetereka. Rais Samia Suluhu kama walivyo viongozi wengine amedhihirisha hekima zake baada ya kuwaambia viongozi wastaafu kuwa anahitaji mchango wao katika uongozi wake. Samia alisema, ""Niwaombe wazee wangu wa pande zote za Muungano, lakini pia viongozi wengine wastaafu kwamba mimi ni kijana wenu pia kama alivyokuwa Rais Magufuli. Pia nami nipo tayari kushirikiana nanyi bega kwa bega katika kujenga Tanzania aliyotamani mpendwa wetu na tunayoitamani sisi wote,"" Rais huyu anawasilisha ujumbe kuwa uongozi wake unahusisha pia busara za watangulizi wake,viongozi wastaafu wa chama na serikali kutoka pande zote za Tanzania. Ni hatua kubwa kiuongozi.","Dodoma. Katika hotuba yake ya kumuaga Magufuli, Rais mpya alisema, ""Kwa jirani zetu na marafiki zetu, niwahakikishie tutaulipa wema mliotuonesha kwa kuimarisha na kushamirisha uhusiano wetu nanyi. Kwa hivyo, kuna maswali ya mustakabili ya Kidiplomasia wa Tanzania na Jumuiya ya Kimataifa ambayo watakuwa na wasiwasi waliyotawala. Kwa hivyo, ni mambo gani ambayo yatakuwa kipaumbele katika uongozi wake? Uongozi wa rais mpya utakuwa wa namna gani? Je, ataweza kuendeleza mambo yaliyoanzishwa na mtangulizi wake?

Hatahivyo matumaini miongoni mwa baadhi ya wagonjwa yameweza kufufua tamaa. Hatua hiyo inajiri katika kisa cha Alma Clara Corsini, ajuza wa miaka 95 ambaye alifanikiwa kupona  baada ya kulazwa na dalili za ugonjwa huo  tarehe 5 mwezi Machi  katika hospitali moja mkoani Modena  kaskazini mwa Itali.

''Ndio niko salama . Ni watu wazuri walionitibu vizuri  na tayari wananipeleka nyumbani'' , Corsini aliambia La Gazzetta di Modena akizungumzia kuhusu uangalizi aliopata katika hopsitali hiyo. Gazeti hilo pia lilisema jinsi wataalam walivyosema kwamba Corsini alipona bila kutumia dawa za kukabiliana na virusi ambazo hupewa wagonjwa ili kuwasaidia kukabiliana na maambukizi. Picha ya mwanamke huyo mzee  pamoja na maafisa wa afya waliomtibu ilisambaa sana katika mitandao ya kijamii nchini humo. Mkoa wa Modena upo katika jimbo la Romagna ambalo ndio jimbo la pili zaidi kuathiriwa na virusi vya corona baada ya Lombardy. Emilia Romagna kulingana na data ya kila siku ilisajili zaidi ya visa 8500 na takriban vifo 900 tarehe 23 mwezi Machi. Idadi kubwa ya vifo hukumba watu wenye zaidi ya umri wa miaka 70. Italia, ikiwa na zaidi ya vifo 6000 , imeipiku China  ambayo ilikuwa na vifo 3200 wiki iliopita  kuwa taifa lenye idadi kubwa ya vifo duniani. Hatahivyo idadi ya siku mbili zilizopita inaonesha kupungua kwa visa vya vifo na maambukizi.

Akizungumza baada ya ziara yake baraniu Afrika, Papa amezungumzia suala la  makasisi wenye itikadi kali za kikatoliki ambao wamekuwa wakimkosoa. Wanaoume hao ""hawalitakii mema kanisa "", bali kile wanachokijali ni  "" kubadilisha mapapa, kubadilisha mitindo, kubuni matawi ya kanisa "", alisema. Viongozi wa kanisa katoliki wa Marekani waliwahi kukosoa Papa kwa maoni yake. Hii ni mara ya kwanza kwa Papa kuzungumzia wazi kuhusu uwezekano wa mpasuko ndani ya kanisa katoliki , ambalo lina zaidi ya wafuasi zaidi ya bilioni moja duniani Papa alisema nini  ? Papa Francis alizitoa kauli zake alipokuwa ndani ya ndege iliyomrejesha Roma baada ya ziara aliyoifanya katika mataifa ya  Madagascar, Mauritius  na Msumbiji. Alikuwa ameulizwa swali na mwandishi  kuhusu mashambulio dhidi yake kutoka kwa viongozi mahafidhina wa kanisa Katoliki ,  kupitia vituo vya televisheni na tovuti za Marekani. Baadhi ya viongozi wa Kikatoliki  - hususan Marekani lakini pia katika baadhi ya maeneo mbali mbali duniani  -wamemkosoa  Papa kwa kuchuja imani yao , na hata wamekwishotoa wito wa kujiuzulu kwake. Hawafurahii misimamo yake  kuhusu mazingira na uhamiaji .  Lakini  kubwa zaidi wanapinga hatua zake za kuruhusu waliotalikiana na walioolewa kwa mara ya pili kupokea  ukaristi. ""Siogopi mgawanyiko ,"" alisema Papa Francis  na kuongeza kuwa mengi yametokea katika historia ya kanisa Katoliki  . ""Ninaomba mgawanyiko usitokee , Kwasababu afya ya roho za wengi hulitegemea kanisa ."" Papa Francis samesema kuwa fikra za kisiasa zinachafua namna  mitazamo ya wakosoaji  dhidi yake. ""Vitu ninavyosema kuhusu masuala ya kijamii ni sawa na alivyosema Papa John Paul .  Ninamnukuu na wanasema  ' papa amezidi kuwa mkomunisti ',"" aliwaambia maripota.

"" Ukosoaji  haukutoka tu Marekani bali kutoka maeneo mengine, wakiwemo Curia,"" alisema,  akimaanisha bodi ya utawala ya kanisa katoliki. Je kanisa lilishawahi kugawanyika awali? Katika mwaka   wa  2,000-wa historia yake kanisa katoliki limegawanyika mara kadhaa   na mgawanyiko unaokumbukwa zaidi ni ule wa mwaka 1054, wakati kanisa la Kiorthodox  la mashariki lilijitenga kutoka kwa Roma. Migawanyiko ilisababisha upinzani dhidi ya Papa  -ambapo watu wengine waliodai kuwa mapapa  na na kukataa  kuukubali utawala wa  Rome.

Lakini je wasanii wa muziki wa Afrika Mashariki wameweza kuielimisha na kuikosoa jamii?. Katika kile ambacho kilionekana kama njia ya kuikosoa na kuielimisha jamii King Kaka kwa  jina lake halisi  Kennedy Ombima, mwishoni mwa juma alitoa video tata ya wimbo aliouta 'Wajinga Nyinyi', akikosoa maovu  miongoni mwa  jamii ya Wakenya. Katika wimbo huo amewatuhumu wazi wazi watu binafsi aliowataja majina moja kwa moja pamoja na wabunge na taasisi za umma kwa ufisadi, uliokithiri  na maovu mengine  katika jamii , huku akiwataka Wakenya kutafakari maovu hayo na kuyarekebisha. Aliutumia wimbo huo huwatolea wito Wakenya kutafakari ujumbe wa video yake na kuchukua hatua. Tangu video ya wimbo huo kutoka, imekuwa ndio maarufu zaidi mitandaoni nchini Kenya . Licha ya wimbo 'Wajinga nyinyi' ulioimbwa kwa mtindo wa rap kusifiwa na wengi kuwa maudhui yake yalikua ni ya kweli baadhi ya waliotajwa majina walimkosoa na kutishia kumshitaki. King kaka alidai anatishiwa maisha na kujisalimisha katika Ofisi ya  Mwendeshamashitaka mkuu wa Serikali (DCI), akidai lakini ofisi hiyo ilisema haikumuita. Mwanamuziki huyo ambaye alipata uungaji mkono mkubwa kutoka kwa wasanii wenzake kwa kutoa ujumbe huo, pia aliahidiwa utetezi wa kisheria na mawakili maarufu iwapo atapelekwa mahakamani kwa kuimba wimbo 'Wajinga nyinyi' . Mbali na mwanamuziki King Kaka wanamuziki wengine wa Kenya  pia awali walitoa nyimbo zilizokosoa ufisadi katika jamii yao. Mfanyo ni mwanamuziki Erick wa mtindo wa Afrobit Wainanaina  katika wimbo wake 'Nchi ya kitu kidogo' na  mwanamuziki wa mtindo wa Hiphop Juliani  katika wimbo wake 'Sitasimama maovu yakitawala' Kwa muda sasa wasanii wa muziki nchini Tanzania wamekuwa wakiwasilisha ujumbe wao hususan baada ya kuingia madarakani kwa rais John Pombe Magufuli.  Ukosoaji wao  umekua ni ukijibu  yanayofanyika nchini mwao. Wa kwanza alikua ni wanamuziki ni mwanamuziki wa Hip hop  Karama Masopud na wimbo wake 'Magufuli balaa ' , al maarufu Kalapina. Hata hivyo kalapina ambaye alishindwa katika harakatii zake za kuwania ubunge, alitoa wimbo mwingine wa kumsifu rais Magufuli.  Aliimba: 'Unaweza kudhani ni ni miujiza lakini ni picha halisi. Upinani uko kimya, hauna la kusema. Amefanya walichopanga kukifanya.'' Msanii mwingine  aliyekuwa na ujumbe wa ukosoaji miongo ni mwa jamii, ni mwanamuziki wa mtindo wa rap, Nikki Mbishi ambapo Januari 2017 aliimba:''I'm Sorry JK.'' Mtangulizi wa rais John Pombe Magufuli , Jakaya Kikwete, alifahamika kama 'JK'. ''Itaeleweka ikiwa nitasema siku moja kwamba, hakuna rais kama JK. Watanzania wanakukosa sanana kwa niaba ya Watanzania ninasema wanakukosa sana na wanatamani ungegombea awamu ya tatu kama rais'' Katika wimbo huo, msanii aliongelea  kuhusu  namna baadhi ya Watanzania akiwemo yeye walimkosoa vibaya Kikwete alipokua mamlakani lakini sasa wanamkosa na kutamani angegombea awamu ya tatu mamlakani!. Alisema kwa sasa hakuna uhuru wa vyombo vya habari. Mikopo ya wanafunzi wa Chuo Kikuu haipatikani tena kwa urahisi, uchumi unadhoofika na benki zinakabiliwa na wakati mgumu, hakuna pesa mitaani na demokrasia imebanwa, miongoni mwa mambo mengine. Baraza la Sanaa Tanzania (Basata) lilimuita msanii huyo wa muziki wa rap na kumhoji. Baadae aliandika taarifa katika kituo cha polisi jijini Dar es salaam, na wimbo wake ukapigwa marufuku  mnamo mwezi wa Februari  2017. Kufuatia kuvamiwa kwa kituo cha TV na mshirika wa karibu wa rais, John Magufuli  Paul Makonda, wasanii wa Hip hop walipeleka hasira zao juu ya kile kilichokua kikiendelea. Ney wa Mitego alitoa wimbo, 'Wapo'.  Ingawa hakutaja moja kwa moja jina lolote la kiongozi katika wimbo wake ilikua wazi kuwa alikua akielezea maeneo ambayo  rais Joh Pombe Magufuli ''ameshindwa'' kutekeleza wajibu wake. Wimbo huo ulipata umaarufu sana. Alikamatwa mara moja na Basata ikapiga marufuku kabisa wimbo huo. Hata hivyo Jumatatu iliyofuatia, rais Magufuli aliagiza Ney aachiliwe huru na wimbo wake uchezwe. Nyimbo nyingine zilizokosoa utawala wa rais Magufuli ni pamoja na 'Dereva wa 5 hana leseni' wa Wagosi wa Kaya, 'Usinipangie' wa Baghdad na 'Madaraka ya kulevya' wa Weusi. Usinipangie uliimbwa kujibu kauli ya rais Magufuli kusema kuwa hatoambiwa la kufanya. Madaraka ya kulevya ni wimbo ambao mistari yake iliandikwa kwa ustadi lakini yenye utata. Wimbio huo haukuwazungumzia moja kwa moja rais Magufuli au Makonda , lakini maneno yaliyotumiwa yanaonyesha kumuhusu kiongozi aliyelewa mamlaka kukiuka maadili yake ya kiuongozi. Msanii  wa muziki wa rap Profesa Jay katika wimbo wake 'Ndio, mzee aalikosoa utawala wa rais Mkapa miaka ya 2000, Nakaaya Sumari katika wimbo wake Mr politician na Mrisho Mpoto katika wimbo Mjomba ambao wengi wanaamini vilimlenga rais Jakaya Kikwete. Uganda Katika miaka ya hivi karibuni, baadhi ya wasanii nchini Uganda walijitokeza kukosoa maovu wanayodai yanatekelezwa na utawala wa rais wa muda mrefu  yoweri Museveni, huku wengine wakimsifu. Mwaka 2012  katika wimbo wake  Robert Kyagulanyi al maarufu Bobi Wine  katika wimbo wake 'By Far' aliashiria nia yake ya kujiunga na siasa akiukosoa utawala wa rais Museveni. Aliimba : 'My father said there is more politics  music industry than in the Parliement, they dont know who they are dealing with' akimaanisha 'Baba yangu aliniambia kuna siasa zaidi katika muziki kuliko bungeni, lakini hawajui ninani wanaekabiliana nae'. Katika wimbo huu alielezea kuwa wakazi wa vitongoji duni kikiwemo  kitongoji cha  ambako alikua akiishi  hawaogopi vitisho, huku akiwatolea wito raia kuamka na kupigania haki zao. Akiimba kwa kwa lugha ya Luganda  Bibi Wine,  mwaka 2016,  alitoa wimbo 'Dembe' au 'Amani'  Msanii Bobi Wine aliouimba Bobi Wine alikemea kile alichokiita ghasia miongoni mwa viongozi wa Uganda, huku akiwalaumu kwa kuchochea ghasia hususan wakati wa uchaguzi. Aliitaka jamii ya Waganda kupiga kura kwa amani ili kuepuka ghasia zilizojitokeza katika chaguzi zilizopita, akiwatuhumu  viongozi waliopo madarakani kuchochea ghasia hizo. Imekua vigumu kutumia muziki kuelimisha na kukosoa maovu Uganda: Nyimbo zake zilizojaa ukosoaji wa rushwa na ukosefu wa haki za kijamii nchini Uganda zilichangia kwa kiasi kikubwa kuchaguliwa kwa Bobi Wine kama  mbunge wa kyadondo Mashariki mwaka 2017. Mnamo mwaka 2017 , msanii huyo  aliimba: 'Ugandans need equal opportunity', Waganda wanahitaji fursa sawa'', akitaka serikali ifikishe huduma kwa usawa miongoni mwa raia mkiwemo ajira kwa vijana. Hata hivyo juhudi zake za kuendelea kuukosoa utawala wa rais Museveni kupitia usanii wake wa muziki zimegonga  mwamba baada ya maafisa wa usalama kuzuia matamasha yake yote ya muziki. Msanii wa muziki wa Hip hop na Afro bit Uganda ni  Jose Chameleone   kutoka nchini Uganda  ambaye alifahamika kwa kutumbuiza nyimbo zake katika hafla za Chama tawala cha NRM pamoja na matukio mengine ya serikali ya rais Museveni sasa amegeuka kuwa mkosoaji wake. Baada ya Chameleone  Kutangaza nia yake ya kuingia siasa na kugombea  kiti cha Meya wa Jiji Kuu Kampala ili kumaliza maovu yanayofanyika katika mji huo,  rais Museveni ambaye alikua mfuasi wake katika ukurasa wa twitter alimua kuondoa ufuasi wake. Kinyume na Bobi Wine pamoja na Jose' Chamilion, Msanii mwingine maarufu  kwa jina la Bebe Cool amekua mstari wa mbele kuunga mkono utawala wa rais Yoweri Museveni, huku akiwakosoa wasanii wenzake kwa kuukosoa utawala. Ni dhahiri kuwa wasanii wengi wa muziki katika nchi za Afrika Mashariki wamekua wakitumia  kazi yao kuzielimisha na kuzikosoa jamii zao, japo katika mazingira magumu inapokuja katika ukosoaji wa kisiasa.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-49567501,"Papa Francis leo anaanza ziara rasmi ya kihotoria  barani Afrika wiki hii - akiwa anazitembelea  Msumbiji, Madagascar na Mauritius. Umaskini, uhifadhi wa mazingira na ufisadi ni miongoni mwa mambo yanatorajiwa kuigubika ziara ya Papa katika mataifa ya Afrika. Wahudumu katika kanisa katoliki wamenukuliwa na baadhi ya vyombo vya habari wakisema kwamba ziara hii ambayo ni ya pili Papa Francis kuwahi kuifanya kusini mwa jangwa la Sahara Afrika, ni fursa muhimu kutoa wito mpya uliogubikwa katika barua yake ya mnamo 2015 ""Laudato Si"" inayuhusu kulinda mazingira. Katika mataifa ya Msumbiji na Madagascar kumeshuhudiwa pakubwa tatizo la ukataji miti. Mambo ambayo pamoja na mmomonyoko wa udongo, yamechangia Msumbiji kuwa katika hatari  wakati vimbunga viwili vilipotuwa katika taifa hili mwaka huu, linaripoti shirika la habari la Reuters. Kwa mujibu wa takwimu za benki ya Dunia, Msumbiji imepoteza hekari milioni 8 za misitu - tangu katika miaka ya 70. Masuala mengine yanayotarajiwa kuigubika ziara ya Papa katika mataifa hayo ya Afrika ni umasikini, vita na ufisadi au rushwa. Katika mahojiano naVatican News, Kadinali Pietro Parolin, ambaye ni waziri wa mambo ya nje wa Vatican amesema Papa anatazamiwa kutuma ujumbe mzito kuhusu amani  na majadiliano. Licha ya kwamba baadhi hulihusisha bara la Afrika na matatizo kama mizozo na majanga, kadinali huyo anaamini kuwa ""Afrika ni zaidi ya yote eneo lililo na utajiri wa utu au ubinaadamu, lenye utajiri wa maadili na imani"",  na kwamba anahisi Papa anafanya ziara hii akiwa pia na hisia kama hizi, inaripoti Vatican news. Ziara hii ya Papa Francis inatazamwa kama jitihada zake ya kuwa na malengo mapya chini ya uongozi wake baada ya kashfa za miezi kadhaa kuhusu namna kesi za unyanyasaji wa kingono zilivyoshughulikiwa. Papa Francis anaonekana kuwa na umakini wa kurudi katika kauli mbiu ya amani, utengamano na jitihada za kumaliza umaskini. Mara ya mwisho Papa Francis kuizuru Afrika ilikuwa Novemba 25 mnamo 2015. Alianza kwa kutua nchini Kenya akaelekea Uganda na kumalizia ziara hiyo katika Jamhuri ya Afrika ya Kati. Katika ziara hiyo ya siku sita, Papa alieneza ujumbe wake wa Amani, maridhiano, mashauriano na kuchochea juhudi za kuzima migawanyiko. Akiwa nchini Kenya, Papa Francis alisema: ""Vijana ndio rasilimali yenye thamani zaidi kwa taifa. Kuwalinda, kuwekeza katika vijana, na kuwasaidia, ndiyo njia bora zaidi ya kuhakikisha siku njema za usoni zenye kufuata busara na maadili ya kiroho ya wazee wetu, maadili ambayo ndiyo nguzo ya jamii."" Papa alitumia Kiswahili kuhitimisha hotuba yake, akisema: ""Mungu abariki Kenya!"" Alikuwa ameandika maneno yayo hayo kwenye akaunti yake ya mtandao wa kijamii wa Twitter alipokuwa safarini, saa moja hivi kabla ya kuwasili Kenya. Kando na Papa Francis, Mapapa wawili wengine wamewahi kuzuru mataifa ya Afrika. Wa kwanza alikuwa Papa Paul VI aliyezuru Uganda mwaka 1969. Baadaye Mtakatifu John Paul II alizuru mataifa 42 ya Afrika akitembelea Kenya mwaka 1980, mwaka 1985 na mwaka 1995; Uganda mwaka 1993; na Jamhuri ya Afrika ya Kati 1975.","'Pope Francis recently began his official visit to this African region - while traveling to Mauritius, Madagascar, and Reunion Island.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/habari-49486341,"Miaka karibu 3,500 iliopita, Iran ilikua na dini yake iliyofahamika kama Zoroaster ambayo inasadikiwa kuwa dini ya jadi ya Uajemi. Zoroaster ilikuwa imani rasmi ya Dola kuu ya Uajemi, na hekalu lake la moto lilihudhuriwa na mamilioni ya wafuasi. Maelfu ya miaka baada ya ufalme wao kuanguka, wafuasi wa Zoroaster waliteswa hadi wakajiunga na dini mpya ya washindi wao, Uislamu. Miaka 1,500 baada ya imani ya Zoroaster kupotea moto wake unaoaminiwa kuwa mtakatifu huhifadhiwa na wafuasi wachache. Tunachukulia tu kwamba dini huzaliwa, hukua na kufa - lakini pia tunapuuza ukweli huo. Lakini sisi pia tunahadaiki kirahisi. Mtu anapoanzisha dini mpya mara nyingi hupuuzwa kuwa dhehebu lakini imani yake ikitambuliwa tunachukulia mafundisho na itikadi zake kama kitu kitakachodumu milele. Na dini inapokufa, inakuwa hadithi, na madai ya utakatifu wake unaisha sawa na hadithi za watu wa asili ya Wamisri, Wagiriki na Waorse amabo sasa hadithi zao sio maandishi takatifu. Hadi wa leo madhehebu makubwa ya kidini yamekua yakibadilika katika historia. Katika dini ya Kikrsto kwa mfano Kanisa la kwanza lilikua kubwa: Hati za zamani zilijumuisha maisha ya familia ya Yesu na ushuhuda kwa ukuu wa Yudasi. Ilichukua karne tatu kwa kanisa la Kikristo kujumuisha maandiko - na ilipofika 1054 ikagawanyika katika makanisa ya Orthodox  na Katoliki. Kutoka wakati huo, Dini ya Kikristo iliendelea kukua  na kugawanyika katika makundi mengi ambayo yanadai kuwa ya kipentekoste. Lakini ukiamini kuwa imani yako iko pale pale basi huenda usione mabadiliko  hayo hata kidogo. Historia inaonesha kuwa hata imani yetu iwe imara kwa kiwango kikubwa leo huenda siku zijazo imani zetu zikabadilika, kubadilishwa na vizazi vyetu vijavyo au kupotea kabisa. Ikiwa dini zilibadilika zama za kale kuna uwezekano hali kama hiyo ikajirudia siku zijazo? Je kuna ukweli wowote kuwa imani ya miungu nayo itapotelea mbali? Na kadri maendeleo yetu na teknolojia zake zinavyozidi kuwa ngumu zaidi, Je kuna uwezekano wa kuibuka kwa aina mpya za ibada? Kujibu maswali haya ni vyema kujiiliza: Kwa nini tuna dini? Mfaransa huyo alikuwa anahoji juu ya imani ya watu kwa Mungu kama inafanya kazi kiufasaha. Kama Mungu hakuruhusu makanisa mengi iweje kila kukicha yanafunguliwa. Wanafunsi wa dini ya sasa walikubaliana naye kuwa wazo la imani linapaswa kuzingatiwa na dini zote katika utendaji wake. Kuna matajiri wengi wanatumia dini kukandamiza watu maskini wakidai kuwa wanataka kuwasaidia kumbe ni uongo. Lengo la dini ni kuwajumuisha watu waishi pamoja kwa amani na upendo lakini si kutumia dini kuunga mkono itikadi za siasa au kutoa matumaini ambayo utekelezaji wake ni hafifu. Wamekuwa wakianzisha imani zao huku wakichanganya tamaduni mbalimbali. Msimu wa sikukuu za dini kama Krismasi na pasaka, viashiria vingi vya upagani vimejumuishwa katika sherehe hizo za dini jambo ambalo si sawa. Mpaka leo hii jamii yetu imechanganya imani ya dini na tamaduni mbalimbali na idadi ya watu wanaodai kuwa hawana dini inazidi kuongezeka. Wanasayansi nao wanataka watu waeleze namna nyingine ya ulimwengu. Licha ya kupotea kwa idadi ya pamoja kwa namba. Mwaka 2015, watafiti walibaini kuwa dini kubwa duniani huwa zinaegemea kwenye mifano, uhamiaji na mawasiliano. Pamoja na kushuka kwa imani ya watu , waumini wapya wataongezeka kutoka asilimia 84 mpaka 87% ifikapo mwaka 2050. Waislamu pia idadi yao itakuwa na kulingana namba ya wakristo. Mabadiliko kama hayo ndio baadi ya mabo waanzilishi wa baadhi ya makundi mapya ya kidini wanataka kuona. Suala la kuzifanya makundi hayo kuwa rasmi sio muhimu cha msingi ni kupata uungwaji mkono na wafuasi wengi katika harakati zinazopiganiwa katika jamii. Baada ya kutumia miongo kadhaa kutafuta suluhisho la kiuhandisi la kukabiliana na mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa mwanzilishi wake Olya Irzak alibaini kuwa suluhisho halisi halipo katika juhudi za kiufundi bali ni kutafuta uungwaji mkono na jamii. ""Uungwaji mkono huo ni sawa na kuwaongoza watu katika dhehebu la kulinda mazindira ?"" anasema. ""ni dini inayokabiliwa na changamoto kubwa."" Miaka mitatu iliopita Irzak na mararafiki zake waliongana kuanzisha dhehebu hilo na wanasema hawakuona haja ya kuingiza suala la Mungu katika mradi huo. Wafuasi wa ''dhehebu''hilo la kutunza mazingira hukutana mara kwa mara kusherhekea siku kuu ya kuadhimisha ufanisi wa kazi  yao. Wanaohudhuria sherehe hiyo hupanda miti badala ya kukata miti wakati wa makumbusho ya kuyeyoka kwa barafu maarufu ''Glacier Memorial Day'', huku wakishuhudia miamba ya barafu ikiyeyuka chini ya jua la California. Huu ni mfano mzuri wa kutunza mazingira  kupitia matukio yanayotokana na mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa- lakini wanaojiunga na vugu vugu hili wanastahili kuhamasishwa kuhusu umuhimu wake. ""Tunatumai kuwa watu watapata thamani ya kuhifadhi mazingira ili kujilinda dhidi ya mabadiliko ya tabia nchi,"" anasema badala ya kulalamika mazingira yalivyochafuliwa. Hivi karibuni watafiti waliangazia tamaduni zingine ulimwenguni  ikiwa ni pamoja na sherhe za kidini zinazofanywa katika maeneo ya Mashariki ya Kati na sehemu za Kati za Bara Asia. Waligundua utamaduni wa kutupa vitu kwenye moto na kisha kuruka moto h uo kama sehemu ya kujitakasa imekua ikiendelea. Utamaduni huo huenda ilitarajiwa kuendelea kwa maelfu ya miaka ijayo sababu utamaduni huo bado unatekelezwa kila mwaka mpya wa Nowruz na waumini wa dini ya jadi Zoroaste nchini ya Iran. Huenda ni kweli dini zisitoweke lakini tatizo ni madhehebu ya kidini yanayoibuka huenda hayana mashiko kama tunavyofikiria. Lakini wadadisi wa masuala ya kidini wanasema madhehebu mengine makubwa yataendelewa kuanzishwa.","ahitaji kujitakasa. Kwa hivyo, wanaohudhuria kuhifadhi mazingira kwa kawaida na kuhitaji kujitakasa.

Jiulize je unaweza kuwa ni feki? Muonekano unaweza kukudanganya Unawezekana kutumia akaunti au nembo rasmi  na mamlaka, mkiwemo  BBC News na BBC News Swahili  na serikali. Screenshoti pia inaweza kubadilishwa na kufanywa ionekane kama taarifa iliyotoka katika taasisi ya umma ya kuaminika. Angalia na hakiki kurasa na tovuti.   Kama hauwezi kupata taarifa hiyo  kwa urahisi, inaweza kuwa ni taarifa gushi. Na kama ujumbe wa maandishi, video  au kinganishi(link) vinaonekana kuwa ni gushi -huenda kweli vikawa ni gushi. Herufi kubwa na muundo wa herufi  haufanani basi ufahamu kuwa unafaa kuuchunguza ujumbe huo zaidi  kwani ni kiashirio kuwa ujumbe huo unaweza kuwa unapotosha. 4.Hauna uhakika kuwa ni wa ukweli? Usishirikishe wengine Usishirikishe watu wengine vitu kwa kusema  ""labda inaweza''  unaweza kuwa ni ukweli. Unaweza kusababisha madhara kuliko kutenda wema kwa kutuma ujumbe kama huo. Mara nying hua tunatuma vitu katika maeneo ambayo tunafahamu kuw akuna wataalamu-kama madaktari au wataalamu wa tiba . Hilo linaweza kuwa SAWA, lakini hakikisha hakikisha kwanza unaelezea wasiwasi wako kuhusu ujumbe unaoutuma . Na ufahamu -kwamba picha au maandishi unayoshirikisha yanaweza kuondlewa dhana yake baadae. 5. Tazama kila taarifa kwa umakini Kuna ujumbe wa sauti ambao umekua ukizunguka kwenye  WhatsApp. Mtu ambaye alikua anaongea katika ujumbe huo alisema kuwa anatafsiri ushauri kutoka kwa ""rafiki wanaefanya nae kazi""  anayefanya kazi katika hospitali . Ujumbe huo umetumwa kwa BBC na makumi ya watu kutoka maeneo mbali mbali ya dunia. Lakini ujumbe katika sauti hiyo  ni mchanganyiko wa taarifa sahihi na zisizo sahihi. Unapotumiwa orodha ndefu ya ushauri, ni rahisi kuamini kila kitu katika ujumbe kwasababu tu unafahamu unafahamu kuwa kunawa mikono ni ukweli. Lakini hua sio hivyo kila wakati . 6. Kuwa makini na jumbe zenye hisia Ni jambo ambalo huwa linatufanya kuwa waoga, wenye hasira, wenye wasiwasi , au kutupatia furaha ambalo husambazwa zaidi. ""Uoga ni moja ya mambo makubwa yanayosababisha kusambaa kwa taarifa zisizo sahihi  ,""anasema  Claire Wardle wa  First Draft, shirika linalosaidia waandishi wa habari kukabiliana na taarifa gushi zinazoshirikishwa kwenye mitandao . Taarifa za miito yadharura ya kuchukua hatuahubuniwa ili kuzusha wasiwasi-kwa hivyo uwe mwangalifu. ""Watu wanataka kusaidia ndugu zai kuwa salama, kwahivyo wanapoona ujumbe unaosema  'Mbinu za kuzuwia virusi !' au ' Meza dawa hii mbadal!' watu hutaka kufanya lolote liwezekanalo kusaidia   wenzao kwa kuwatumia ujumbe huo ,"" anasema. 7. Fikiria kuhusu upendeleo Je unashirikisha kitu kwasababu inafahamu kuwa ni kweli-au tu kwasababu unaimani nao? Carl Miller, mtafiti na mkurugenzi wa kituo cha tathmini ya mitandao ya kijamii katika taasisi ya think tank -Demos, anasema tuna uwezekano mkubwa wa kushirikisha taarifa zinazoimarisha fikra tulizonazo.","'The latest information on Coronavirus is circulating in meetings and experts are providing advice to the public to use ""clean information"".

Kufunga mwezi mtukufu wa Ramadhan ni tendo la ibada, ambalo linawawezesha Waislamu kujiweka karibu na Mungu na kuimarisha imani yao ya kidini. Hata hivyo, mbali na hayo, ni kipindi ambacho watu hujikuta wakila aina nyingi ya vyakula wakati wanapofungua mfungo. Lakini je, unajua ni aina gani ya vyakula mtu aliyefunga anastahili kula? Kulingana na Dkt. Lawan Musa Tahir, wa mjini Abuja kwanza kuna wale ambao pengine ni wagonjwa wa kisukari au wenye maradhi ya ini, wanastahili kuendelea kuzingatia vyakula vyao. Hali hii ni sawa na yeyote mwenye tatizo na chakula fulani, pengine miili yao hudhurika wanapokula vyakula fulani, hata kama umefunga mwezi wa Ramadhani, unapofungua zingatia vyakula vyako vya kila siku. Pia kuna mazingira tofauti ya kuishi, kuna wale wanaoishi maeneo ya jua kali ambako watu wanakunywa maji mara kwa mara. Wanapofungua wajitahidi kunywa maji kwa wingi. Unapofunga mwezi wa Ramadani, sio tu kwamba unabadilisha mfumo wako wa kula bali pia mfumo wa kulala, na pia utakuwa katika mabadiliko ya kimwili na kisaikolojia. Pia ni vyema kufahamu kuwa mwili kutokuwa na maji ya kutosha na kukosa kula kwa wakati kama ulivyozoea, kasi ya umeng'enyaji wa chakula inapungua ili kutumia nguvu ulio nayo kwa ufasaha zaidi. Ni wazi kwamba kipindi cha mfungo wa Ramadhani kama hiki, sio tu suala la chakula utakachokula, lakini pia kiwango cha chakula na aina ya chakula unachokula, kuna umuhimu mkubwa kuhakikisha mwili unakuwa na afya njema kila wakati. Na ili kuwa na nguvu na virutubisho vinavyohitajika mwilini kila siku, unastahili kula vyakula vyenye protini, wanga, vitamini na madini mengine, na pia unastahili kuhakikisha unakunywa maji ya kutosha.","'The fasting of Ramadan is a duty that the Islamic religion imposes from dawn until dusk in a place where one is present.

https://www.bbc.com/swahili/articles/cv27yrpr7dro,"Baada ya Elon Musk kuchukua uongozi wa Twitter, baadhi ya watumiaji wamekuwa wakitafuta majukwa mbadala. Mnufaikaji mkubwa  ni Mastodon. Lakini ni nini? Mtandao huo wa kijamii unasema sasa ina zaidi ua watumiaji 655,000 us – baada y azadi ya watumiaji 230,000 kujiunga nao wiki iliyopita. Mastodon inaonekana kama Twitter – watumiaji wanaandika ujumbe (unaoitwa ""toots""), ambao unaweza kujibiwa, kupendwa na kushirikishwa, na pia watumiaji kufuatiliana. Lakini kilichojitokeza ni kwamba, mtandao huu unafanya kazi kwa njia tofauti. Jukwaa hili limekuwepo kwa miaka sita lakini shughuli yake ya sasa ni ya kipekee na inajitahidi kumudu ongezeko la watumiaji wapya. Huu hapa ni mwongozo mfupi utakaokusaidia kuelewa mtandao wa Mastodon unavyofanya kazi. Jambo la kwanza unapaswa kufanya unapojisajili ni kuchagua seva. Kuna seva nyingi na yote  yana mada - zilizogawanywa kwa nchi, jiji au mahitaji - kama vile Uingereza, kijamii, teknolojia, michezo ya kubahatisha na kadhalika. Haijalishi umejiunga na seva ipi kwa sababu utaweza kufuatilia watumiaji wengine wote, lakini inakujumuisha katika jamii ambayo ya ina uwezekano mkubwa wa kuchapisha mambo ambayo yanayokuvutia pia. Baadhi ya zile maarufu - kama vile za kijamii na Uingereza - kwa sasa zinaendelea polepole sana kwa sababu ya mahitaji. Ryan Wild, ambaye anaendesha seva ya MastodonApp.UK kupitia kampuni yake ya Superior Networks, anasema alikuwa na washiriki wapya zaidi ya 6,000 ndani ya saa 24 na ilibidi asitishe usajili. Seva unayochagua inakuwa sehemu ya jina lako la mtumiaji - kwa mfano, nilitumia utambulisho wangu wa sasa wa Twitter, zsk, na kuchagua seva ya Uingereza, na kufanya jina langu la mtumiaji @zsk@mastodonapp.uk. Na hiyo ndiyo anwani yangu hapo - utafuta nini ili unipate? Ikiwa uko kwenye seva moja, unaweza kutafuta tu kwa kutumia jina la mtu huyo, lakini ikiwa yuko kwenye seva tofauti utahitaji anwani yake kamili. Tofauti na Twitter, Mastodon haitapendekeza wafuasi ambao unaweza kuwa na hamu. Ikiwa uko kwenye seva moja, unaweza kutafuta tu kwa kutumia jina la mtu huyo, lakini ikiwa yuko kwenye seva tofauti utahitaji anwani yake kamili. Tofauti na Twitter, Mastodon haitapendekeza wafuasi ambao unaweza kuwa na hamu. Unaweza pia kutafuta hashtag. Hii ni ngumu, lakini nitajaribu kuelezea. Mastodon sio jukwaa moja. Sio ""kitu"" kimoja na haimilikiwi na mtu mmoja au kampuni. Seva hizi zote tofauti huunganishwa pamoja, na kuunda mtandao wa pamoja, lakini zinamilikiwa na watu na mashirika tofauti. Mfumo huu unaitwa kugatuliwa, na mashabiki wa majukwaa yaliyogatuliwa kama wao kwa sababu hii haswa - hayawezi kuendeshwa kwa matakwa ya chombo kimoja, kununuliwa au kuuzwa. Mastodon inawaomba wamiliki wa seva kuwapa watumiaji wao notisi ya miezi mitatu ikiwa wataamua kuifunga. Mwanzilishi wa awali wa Twitter, Jack Dorsey, anafanya kazi kwenye mtandao mpya uitwao BlueSky, pembeni - na amesema anataka hilo pia kugawanywa. Ni suala tata lakini kwa sasa seva zote zina sheria zao za udhibiti, na zingine hazina. Baadhi ya seva zinachagua kutounganishwa na zingine ambazo zimejaa roboti au zinaonekana kuwa na idadi kubwa ya maudhui ya chuki - hii inamaanisha kuwa hazitaonekana kwa wale walio kwenye seva ambako zimedhibitiwa. Machapisho yanaweza pia kuripotiwa kwa wamiliki wa seva. Ikiwa ni matamshi ya chuki au maudhui yanayokiuka sheria basi wamiliki hao wanaweza kuifuta - lakini hiyo si lazima ifute kila mahali. Litakuwa suala kubwa jukwaa hili likiendelea kukua. Tayari kuna ripoti za watu kulengwa na maudhui ya chuki na BBC imeona mifano ya unyanyasaji wa wapenzi wa jinsia moja. Hapana. Hakuna matangazo ingawa pia hakuna kitu cha kukuzuia kuandika chapisho la kukuza kampuni au bidhaa yako. Mastodon pia haitoi ujumbe ulioratibiwa kama inavyofanya Twitter bali mtumiaji anapata ujumbe kulingana na jinsi ulivyochapishwa - kwa ujumla unaona kile wafuasi wako wanasema, kama jinsi ilivyo. Inategemea umejiunga na seva gani - sbaadhi zinaomba mchango, kwa sababu hawapati malipo lakini huduma ya Mastodon ya ni bure kwa kiwango kikubwa.","'After Elon Musk took over the management of Twitter, many users started looking for an alternative platform.

Mastodon is not a single thing or owned by one person or company. These services are collectively called a federation, and the federated platforms are called federated. The term is used because they cannot be controlled by a single large company, they are decentralized. Mastodon does not send out notices to users about updates every three months. The initial Twitter co-founder, Jack Dorsey, worked on the new platform, Bluesky, as a consultant – and said he wanted it to be included too. It's a big issue but currently all these services have their own terms and conditions, and some have others.

China claims this is the first time such an incident has occurred, and that for many years there had been no issues with trade relations between China and Kenya, including food safety, office supplies, food products, and everything was being supplied without any problems.

""Usually I get briefings from the police chief and I am not sure if it is internet news or not because the police chief gets information from the customs department, so if they get information like this, they will verify it first before we can discuss it."" It also states there was no news that the container had been loaded. In another case, an investigation was carried out based on information from the customs department in Kenya, which was not in agreement with the news Kenya received about the container that was loaded and was causing a stir in China-Kenya trade relations.
